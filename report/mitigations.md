# Mitigations for "It won't Work"

There may be some settings (as in a course with very large programming
assignments) where the knee-jerk reaction is to say that in-flow "won't work",
(because, for example, it takes too much time).  We should think about
mitigations for these scenarios to see whether in-flow can be adapted for
scenarios that seem difficult at first.

## Programs too large, review takes too long


## Too many students don't share a common language


## Classroom/institution/geographic culture discourages feedback/criticism


## Fear of students being rude/abrasive/offensive, or high consequences for it
