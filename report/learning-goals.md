# Learning Goals for In-flow Peer Review

A catalog of learning goals that IfPR has, for comparison to other teaching
techniques and tools that may accomplish the same goals, and to motivate
different review styles.

## Program comprehension

Relevant for uses if IFPR that have rubrics that present code, and are teaching
students to understand and comment on code.  How big of a program chunk should
be shown, and what parts should be emphasized?  Should the interface give them
hints about where to start looking?

Also, that working group report does a fascinating thing with laying out a
visual language to compare different approaches to understanding program
comprehension.  It's a neat approach for a working group, and maybe we could do
something similar with our case studies: find a common language for describing
their components and laying it out.


## Communication skills

IFPR is a type of contributing student pedagogy
(http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1473242), which broadly describes curricula
in which students take an active role in teaching one another.

## Learning new programming strategies

## Increasing confidence about sharing code
