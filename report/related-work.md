## Peer assessment

One related area of work is _peer graading_, which has peers read one
anothers' work after assignments have been turned in, and judge their quality.
There is recent work by Scott Klemmer's group here in this area that everyone
should be aware of:

This gives techniques for measuring the quality of peer reviewing against how
human TAs would grade the same artifacts, and judging how far off the students
are likely to be.

There is a recent (5 years) survey of peer assessment tools, that everyone
should be aware of:

There is an earlier survey of peer review by Topping that we found predated
other uses of in-flow styles of review, but is still focused on peer review in
CS courses:

A bunch of the related work of
http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/ppkf-ct-multi-stage-in-flow/
is relevant here, as well, which provides somewhat of a survey of the peer
assessment literature.


## Learning by example

One goal of peer review is to have students learn from seeing one anothers'
work.  Some related studies:

Examples improving creative work:

Also the idea of a "contributing student pedagogy" is relevant here:

In PeerWise, students created and reviewed one anothers' multiple-choice
questions:

## Peer coaching/teaching

There's an entire field of "Peer Coaching", seemingly mostly used for
staff/teacher development and a bit in the business world:

Peer coaching: a practical model to support constructivist learning methods in the development of managerial competency

Impact of peer coaching on self-efficacy and instructional skills in TEFL teacher education:

Eric Mazur has been working on the idea of peer instruction for a long time
(here's a 10 years review), the idea is to have students explain solutions to
one another.

## Program comprehension

The WG on program comprehension is good to read, because it also shows what a
WG can accomplish:

They studied several works on program comprehension that could be good to keep
in mind while considering size/duration of review activities:

http://dl.acm.org.revproxy.brown.edu/citation.cfm?id=322685&CFID=472720597&CFTOKEN=32164599
http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/Prog-Comp/Papers/soloway84.pdf
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016412128790032X

I'm not sure if there's much on program comprehension via talking about
programs; these seem to mostly discuss the cognitive process of looking at and
possibly running a program to explore it, but not understanding it by writing
an explanation of it.
