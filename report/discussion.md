# Discussion points arising from assignment

10. After reading Tony Clear's assignment 2, which stated more or less that pair programming 
and peer review could be integrated. How could this be done? They seem to have overlapping 
goals, but are also different.

231. What are the best ways of ensuring quality of feedback and dealing with misleading feedback?

232. Some assignments have a corresponding _real world_ form of in-flow feedback. Research paper
writing (Clear) has review writing. Software design (Clarke) has design reviews. etc. By exploiting
this correspondence, one gets to teach two skills for one.
