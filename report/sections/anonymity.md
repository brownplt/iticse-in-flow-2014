Should reviews be anonymous (to students, to faculty)?

There are several issues relating to anonymity and privacy which come to the fore in peer review settings.  Developing a culture of positive and constructive critique, where students can both give and take feedback positively can take time and require a degree of practice.  While the broader aim may be to develop a positive, supportive and professional approach to peer review, there may be a need to provide some initial shielding from scrutiny for students who are new to the institution or the practice.  Some of the options, their respective benefits and downsides are presented in this section.

There are varying degrees of anonymity that may be adopted.  For instance the reviews could be anonymous to either students or faculty (or alternatively to both, or neither). Each of the review authors and work authors/review recipients could be anonymous.  

In PeerWise [Denny et al 2008], student submissions are ranked for quality and correctness and the content of the contributed questions is public.  In that case, not revealing contributor identities to peers is quite important, as this creates a degree of safety for the novice student contributor and the public ranking should be identified with the work and not with the student.  However the contributor identities are visible to the instructors as student contributions may be summatively graded.  A variant on this (similar to some conference reviewing models) could also see reviews made visible to all reviewers, which may help in establishing and reinforcing norms and standards and mitigate the risks of unduly harsh or abusive reviews. 

One of the downsides of anonymity is the scope for unwittingly enabling a culture of ‘flaming’ and online harassment to develop among some of the students.  Therefore if reviews are to be done anonymously, policies and techniques for reporting abuse, etc. should be in place.  It is not desirable to have students decide not to pursue the major due to feeling vulnerable, or unsafe.  Anonymous reviewing models demand a level of oversight, as there could be problems with harassment, etc., if reviews were not checked rigorously or students could not affirmatively report abuse.

The potential for danger is greater if reviews are directly involved with grading, and therefore the impact of the reviews is heightened. The incorrectness of a review is mainly a concern if grades are involved, otherwise the student may just ignore it.  The validity of peer grading raises several additional questions.  In many respects this relates to the unsatisfactory aspects of peer assessment schemes in groupwork that ask group members to evaluate relative contributions [Clear, 2010].

In contrast there are several potential gains from not being anonymous: students get feedback on what things to do together towards meeting goals, and this can create a culture of helping one another.  A review is a contribution, so students get to acknowledge people giving helpful feedback.  The course context may demand that students be visible and professional, so in that setting non-anonymity helps enforce a level of accountability for students, and an awareness that they will need to stand by their opinions and be prepared to justify them.  

Open peer review can help with preparation for working in professional settings. Industrial code reviews are not done anonymously [Rombach et al., 2008]. Some code review is within a team, and some is from outside the team.  When industrial code review is performed by people outside the team, this can be a very testing process as there can be no assumption that reviewers have same vested interests.  

As a broader educational goal, ethics and professionalism are meant to be covered as part of our curricula [Fuller et al., 2010], and an open model for peer review gives a clear opportunity for enforcing appropriate behaviour.  

Yet it must be acknowledged that at the introductory level students suffer from both confidence and maturity problems.  Nonetheless there are strategies that may help work towards a more open and professional approach to peer review.  Different courses may have different levels of visibility. The first time at an institution, it may be wise to “play it safe” with peer review (and conduct reviews anonymously).  But by junior/senior level, students are training to be professionals, and this is what professionals are expected to do.  

Anonymity may have cultural connections at several levels: for students who come from a consensus-based national culture [cf. Hofstede, http://scholar.google.co.nz.ezproxy.aut.ac.nz/citations?user=Q2V0P6oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra Leung et al., etc.], where preserving harmony is a strong value and overt criticism can be considered offensive or cause a loss of face, a greater level of anonymity may be required at first for students to feel more at ease in speaking their minds.  

A converse cultural aspect may be in operation with non-anonymous contributions: if students know the other person, they may be less or more critical a priori, based upon judgements of the peer’s relative status or perceived expertise, rather than reviewing the material in its own right.

There may be value in revealing the identity after a first review has been submitted, where a reveal-on-submit strategy may be good for avoiding initial bias but encouraging later collaboration.  For instance see Kathi’s case study [ ref??] on staged anonymity; at first anonymous, then groups review one another once formed, which is identifiable and social.

At some institutions such as Brown University, anonymity is already questionable, because students are acting as TAs for one another anyway, and know about one another’s performance. Culturally at Brown, it does not fit with the institutional and student culture to have anonymity on who is reading your code.

There are other potential benefits to non-anonymity, which may result in enabling direct channels (outside the peer-review system) between students.  It is an open question whether this is more likely to be annoying, or to be useful? It may tell a student about peers they do or don’t want to work with in future! This could be a good way to find like-minded students or facilitate social/professional connections.  Showing names would also allow for multiple rounds of clarification that may or may not be tool-supported.

The group debated whether giving students choice in anonymization was a good or bad a bad idea, and concluded that it was not desirable because it encouraged hiding attitudes, and may make people justify being more objectionably critical because they were allowed to be anonymous.  A further negative was that it would not bring the shy students out (which is sometimes the educator’s goal).  It was concluded that the preferable approach was to assume that students were reasonable, and set the class up that way. Then should problems arise they could be dealt with on a case by case basis.  

It seemed inappropriate to adopt anonymity as the default model, since it could unwittingly set up the expectation in students that IFPR is dangerous.  It is recommended that the approach and the underlying goals and expectations be consciously introduced from the outset.  This could be talked about as explicitly and strongly as the discussions about plagiarism, with potential penalties for abuse of the system through lack of respect for one another. If deemed necessary, an initial anonymous phase could be contemplated from which instructors should migrate relatively quickly to an open peer review model, once students were comfortable with the process.
