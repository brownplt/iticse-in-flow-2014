# Migating the Costs

IFPR can impose extra costs both to the teaching staff and to the students taking
part in the process. Firstly, the increased learning attained by IFPR be 
commensurate with the learning benefits. Secondly, it must be appraised whether
the implementation costs, such as extra scheduling and expert support can be
sustainably given and whether it is possible to mitigate them by larger one
time investments, such as software systems.

To evaluate these costs, the practitioner needs to make an informed decision
on the goal of adopting such system. If the goal is merely to save teacher
resources by offloading some of the work to the students it is much more
critical to focus on allaying ongoing implementation costs than when IFPR
is intended to change the pedagogy of the course. On the latter case, the
practitioner may accept much higher costs than otherwise. For example, 
to ensure that students benefit from the reviews can require
extra time during which students revise their work. Also, additional 
learning goals associated with IFPR, such as goals about reflection
and and review skills, are not free in sense of student or teacher
workload. 

## Moderators of teacher workload

The working group found two primary moderators for teacher workload. The
primary mitigator is, somewhat, naturally, to use a software system
such as CaptainTeach (CITE) to handle the routine tasks such as reviewer
assignments and rudimentary monitoring of process. 

Depending on resources, such software systems can perform quite advanced
tasks, such as giving basic feedback on review quality through use
of machine learning methods (CITE Expertiza) or to maximize variety
of review tasks using static analysis tools to appraise source code
similarity.

The second moderator is the effect of including teaching assistants
in the review process, which can affect the costs both ways: if
teaching assistants are required to moderate the review process, the
costs can increase significantly, especially in large classes.
However, peer review in general can help to reduce teaching assistants
workload by moving some of their tasks to students.

## Moderators of student workload

There are also two primary moderators for student workloads. Firstly,
the review assignment itself will increase the cognitive load of the
students, especially if it is done in an in-flow setting, where it
can force students to switch between very different tasks, such as
switching repeatedly from programming to reviewing and back.

The second primary moderator is the tool support, which can have 
significant effect on student productivity. A review system
integrated with the IDE can be signifcantly cheaper to use than
a separate review system that requires manual steps to access.

Further, it can be possible to moderate student workloads by
careful exercise design, such as attempting to make 
complex problems easier by allowing students to share of parts
of the their solutions during the review process (cf. zone of 
proximal development).

#TODO:

Add something about the set-up costs?
