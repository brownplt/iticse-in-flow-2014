IFPR can impose extra costs on both the teaching staff and the students taking
part in the process and the pracititioner must appraise whether the
implementation costs, such as extra scheduling and expert support, are
commensurate to the learning benefits and whether such costs can be mitigated
by larger one time investments, such as software systems.

To evaluate these costs, the practitioner needs to make an informed decision on
the goal of adopting IFPR. If the goal is merely to save teacher resources by
offloading some of the work to the students, it is much more critical to focus
on allaying ongoing implementation costs than when IFPR is intended drive a
change in the pedagogy of the course. In the latter case, the practitioner may
be willing to accept much higher costs than otherwise. For example, to ensure
that students benefit from the reviews, the practitioner must allocate extra
time during which students may revise their work. Also, the additional learning
goals associated with IFPR, such as fostering reflection and review skills, are
not free in sense of student or teacher workload. 

### Moderators of teacher workload

The working group found two primary moderators for teacher workload. The
primary mitigator i to use a software system such as CaptainTeach (CITE) to
handle the routine tasks like the reviewer assignments and to implement the
necessary means of monitoring the IFPR process. 

Depending on available resources, such software systems can be designed to
perform advanced tasks, such as giving basic feedback on review quality
through use of machine learning methods (CITE Expertiza) or to maximize variety
of review tasks by using static analysis tools to appraise source code similarity.

The different roles of teaching assistants can either increase or allay the
IFPR costs: if the teaching assistants are required to moderate the review
process, the costs can increase significantly in large classes.  However, peer
review can help to reduce workload of the teaching assistants by moving some of
their tasks to students.

### Moderators of student workload

There are also two primary moderators for student workloads. Firstly,
the review assignment itself can increase the cognitive load of the
students when it is done in an in-flow setting by
forcing students to switch between very different tasks, such as
to and fro from programming to reviewing.

The second primary moderator for student workloads is available the tool
support, which can have significant effect on student productivity. A review
system integrated with the IDE can be significantly cheaper to use than a
review system that requires manual operation.

Further, it can be possible to moderate student workloads by careful exercise
design, such as attempting to make complex problems easier by allowing students
to share of parts of the their solutions during the review process (cf. zone of
proximal development).
