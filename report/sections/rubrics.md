* Structure is really a function of students, the course, and the context of the assignment. Structure can be either constraining or liberating.
* Design of rubrics must be very concious -- who do we design the rubric for?
* Rubrics to provide support wheels early on
* Rubrics to provide alibi
  - Focusing on strength important both to foster professional conduct and to help students afraid of rendering negative judgement
* Rubrics to guide effort (there is too much to focus on)
  - Students might be involved in asking what parts they want reviewed, or what style of review they want (these 200 LOC/high-level design) to ensure relevance for reviewee
  - Danger of shifting focus to issues that the students care less about (what are we trying to achieve)
* Evolution of rubrics from specific to general as students mature as reviewers
* Evolution of rubrics from high-level to detailed as students mature as reviewers
* Rationale of a rubric: to give good feedback to the reviewee or to hack the mind of the reviewer
* Scaffolding -- demonstrate the process of reviewing etc. -- process not the same as content
* Analogy with conference reviewing (less mature PC members like lots of little steps)
* Rubrics for communication 
  - Detailed fixed rubrics can be driven by data mining needs
  - Lifting review/rubrics to the level of the class:
    * TAs/students indicate if a response is student/assignment-specific, or if it is a common problem and should be added to the rubric.
    * Ability to make a note to the class based on review
    * Students come up with problems and peer review curates problems for a practice problem set, and practice problem set becomes better for later years
* Rubrics provide starting points for reviews in class
* Possibility to give students choices of sets of rubrics
  - What is more effective for this situation/me/etc.
  - Buy-in from the student
  - Get students to look more constructively at multiple rubrics as way to hack their minds
  - Provide rubrics as free-form text, but you are also able to remove the rubric and put in your own review
* Rubrics can cause students to lock their mind to a certain format or focus. Can be mitigated by giving examples very different from the specific task. 
* Forms of review
  - Face-to-face
  - Text
  - Annotations like lines and arrows between places or highlighting problems or stamping hieroglyphs 
  - Something more formal, lika a patch
* Allot time to deal with misconceptions on how to create a review as part of the course design

* Examples of rubrics:
  - Tests: representative of inputs, and correctness of outputs

  - what Jay McCarthy did
  - Review rubric:
    ~ Completion, timeliness, value of contributions
