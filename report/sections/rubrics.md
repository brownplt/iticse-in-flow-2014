Rubrics serve two important goals in any form of peer review: they
communicate expectations to reviewers (serving as a form of
scaffolding), and they help insure that all authors receive a certain
degree of feedback.  While these goals suggest highly-structured
rubrics, overly structured rubrics can limit reviewers' and authors'
attention to the questions on the rubric.  They can also provide too
much scaffolding, especially once students need to practice evaluating
work from scratch. The tradeoffs around designing rubrics must balance
these tensions.

Rubric design must start from understanding the intent behind the
rubrics.  This includes considering whether the rubrics are designed
to target the reviewer, the author, or the instructor seeking to
understand how students are performing.  These goals are not
necessarily at odds with one another, but are not necessarily
achievable through the same means.

The working group identified several potential roles for rubrics:

*
**Rubrics as support wheels:**
    Rubrics can be great as support wheels, especially early in 
    the student's career as a reviewer

* 
**Rubrics for focus:**
    Rubrics can be used to shift focus from certain aspects to 
    others during a course. This will prevent students from 
    regurgitating different versions of a single review, and also
    reinforce courses where focus shifts during the course. 
    For example, early in the course reviews can focus on functional
    aspects and gradually shift to non-functional aspects of code. 
    Students may also optionally ask for reviews with a certain 
    focus when offering submissions for review. This might help
    to ensure relevance of the review for the author. 

*
**Rubrics for alibi:**
    Rubrics can be great tools to establish alibis for reviewers
    who fear criticising works of others, because of cultural 
    values, self-image, or other factors.  For example, being asked to point
    out one part which could be done better, or identify errors
    will shift the blame from the reviewer who found the bugs
    to the instructor who provided the rubric. 

*
**Rubrics for conduct:**
    Focusing on the strengths of the submission under review can 
    also help reviewers who fear critiquing works of 
    others, but also may be used as a tool to foster professional
    conduct. "Being hard on the issue but soft on the people" can 
    be learned this way. 

*
**Rubrics for time-boxing:**
    This is similar to Rubrics for focus, but here the goal is 
    to control how much time is spent on certain aspects of an 
    submission rather than focusing on just a subset. 

Several design decisions affect rubrics around these choices, as
discussed in the following subsections.

### Different Forms of Reviews

Reviews can take various forms, from written documents to verbal
feedback, from paragraphs to small comments associated with particular
fragments of prose or code, and from individual to group-wide
feedback.  For written reviews, the group noted the general
applicability of plain text, but noted that modern software tools
(such as github) often enable target comments and conversations
between authors and reviewers.  In some situations, a code patch might
be an effective way to convey comments (though might not force the
author to understand the comment deeply).

Face-to-face reviews might be intimidating, regardless of the
involvement of experts. Non-expert TAs can be useful to moderate
face-to-face reviews and enforce a civil tone. Face-to-face
reviews clearly have the benefit of establishing a low-latency
feedback loop, but takes practise to be time-effective. 

### Evolution of and Variation Within Rubrics

Evolving rubrics across a course or curriculum may offer a good
balance between initial scaffolding (for reviewers and authors) and
eventual opportunities for both groups to demonstrate critical
thinking skills.  One model would evolve rubrics from having fairly
targeted questions to asking broad questions: this model gradually
removes scaffolding.  Another form of evolution starts with simple
questions (such as "do these tests look correct") and progresses to
questions on more subtle issues as students master more of the
subject material.  

A variation on evolving rubrics would allow different students to work
with different review forms, depending on their ability as reviewers.
This comment arose from the working group members' experience as PC
members: members often found overly structured forms to be annoying,
feeling they interfered with how they wanted to convey issues with a
work.  

A different form of variation might pose more questions to reviewers
than are conveyed to authors.  This situation could make sense when
the review is used to assess the reviewer's understanding of a work,
or when too much information in a review might distract a novice
student from the critical information in a review.

### Pros and Cons of Rubrics

An important aspects of rubrics is their usage to carry data.
While very detailed and fixed rubrics can be bad in certain ways,
they facilitate data mining and comparison between reviews. For
automatic grading of reviews, fixed structures are clearly very
helpful. Inexperienced students may also be helped to compare
reviews -- either their quality or understand that they give
contradictory advice -- if the reviews are less free-form. Two
students discussing reviews (that they are making or have
received) may be similarly helped by an imposed structure.

The ability to lift reviews (or rubrics, if these can be
influenced by students) to the level of the class is another good
example of rubrics for communication. Students or experts might
see common problems which should be communicated to all, either by
sharing sufficiently general comments with the entire class or
adding a rubric to all reviews which brings attention to the issue
in subsequent reviews.

Rubrics provide starting points for discussing reviews in class,
and for helping students to talk about reviews as noted above. On
the downside, rubrics can cause students to lock their mind to a
certain format or focus. This can be mitigated by giving examples
very different from the specific task. Again, the structure
imposed should be guided by a close inspection of the goals of the
particular review: who is it for, what is the intended outcome,
etc.
