* Introduction/General
** Structure is really a function of students, the course, and the context of the assignment. Structure can be either constraining or liberating.
** Rationale of a rubric: to give good feedback to the reviewee or to hack the mind of the reviewer
** The relation to scaffolding -- demonstrate the process of reviewing etc. -- process not the same as content (rubrics)
** Allot time to deal with misconceptions on how to create a review as part of the course design
* The design parameters of Rubrics
** Design of rubrics must be very concious -- who do we design the rubric for?
** Rubrics to provide support wheels early on
** Rubrics to provide alibi
*** Focusing on strength important both to foster professional conduct and to help students afraid of rendering negative judgement
** Rubrics to guide effort (there is too much to focus on)
*** Students might be involved in asking what parts they want reviewed, or what style of review they want (these 200 LOC/high-level design) to ensure relevance for reviewee
*** Danger of shifting focus to issues that the students care less about (what are we trying to achieve)
* Evolution of Rubrics
** Evolution of rubrics from specific to general as students mature as reviewers
** Evolution of rubrics from high-level to detailed as students mature as reviewers
** Analogy with conference reviewing (less mature PC members like lots of little steps)
* Rubrics for communication 
** Detailed fixed rubrics can be driven by data mining needs
** Lifting review/rubrics to the level of the class:
*** TAs/students indicate if a response is student/assignment-specific, or if it is a common problem and should be added to the rubric.
*** Ability to make a note to the class based on review
*** Students come up with problems and peer review curates problems for a practice problem set, and practice problem set becomes better for later years
* Pros and cons of rubrics
** Rubrics provide starting points for discussing reviews in class
** Rubrics can cause students to lock their mind to a certain format or focus. Can be mitigated by giving examples very different from the specific task. 
* Forms of review
** Possibility to give students choices of sets of rubrics
*** What is more effective for this situation/me/etc.
*** Buy-in from the student
*** Get students to look more constructively at multiple rubrics as way to hack their minds
*** Provide rubrics as free-form text, but you are also able to remove the rubric and put in your own review
** Face-to-face
** Text
** Annotations like lines and arrows between places or highlighting problems or stamping hieroglyphs 
** Something more formal, lika a patch
* Specific Examples
** Tests: representative of inputs, and correctness of outputs
** Review rubric:
*** Completion, timeliness, value of contributions

* Things I might leave out for those who know it better
