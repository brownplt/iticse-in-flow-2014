# Review assignment

Different ways of assigning reviewers can be used affect many aspects of the
IFPR process. For example, the review assignment process can have an effect on
student workload, the professional identity of the students, and performance of
minorities. Furthermore, the in-flow process requires the reviews to be done
promptly, which restricts the review assignment schemes to those that pose
light load on the students. Also, the review assignments must be observed from
two perspectives: from the perspective of the student receiving the review and
from the perspective of the reviewer, who is also seen as beneficiary of this
process. 

The working group identified 5 different assignment patterns
that fit within the constraints of the in-flow:

1) random, where the available reviewers are randomly assigned,
2) temporal order, where the the earliest answer without a review
   is assigned the first available reviewer,
3) pre-assignment, where the review schedule is predefined,
4) stratified, where the reviewers are assigned by an external
   factor such as past performance, and the
5) market model, where students buy and sell reviews.

The review assignment schemes modified in two primary ways:

1) persisting the reviewer assignments so that same student reviews
   work of another throughout a single exercise, course or even a 
   semester, and
2) mutual reviews, where student both reviews and receives reviews
   from the same peer.

Each of the assignment patterns represent different, and valid,
points in the design space of in-flow review with associated
benefits and disadvantages that the practitioner needs to be
aware.

## Random assignment
 
Random selections are effectively the easiest method of reviewer
assignment, but in an in-flow setting, random selections will be
biased according to when students submit their solutions. Those
students who submit work early are more likely to receive work
from students that also submitted early. This effect can be
detrimental on some contexts and need to be migitated with
intermediate deadlines that avoid biasing.

## Temporal order

Assigning reviewers by temporal order maximises the throughput
of the in-flow review system. 

Note to Kathi, Joe and Shriram: you tried this with captain teach,
and we did not discuss it much during the WG. I think you might want 
to expand on this.

## Predefined

Predefined review assignments and review schedule can allow the IFPR
practitioner to have a fixed timetable. Although a predefined timetable
poses an inflexible minimum time which is needed for for each task, it
also ensures that reviews are assigned evenly and that students can make
a more effective use of their time outside of the IFPR process. 

Predefining the reviewer assignments also allows offline stratification
of the process. For example, students can be paired according to their
interests, pre-existing skill level or any other such factor.On the
negative side, predefined schedule is more fragile. Common elements, such
as drop outs can require rescheduling.  

Prescheduling is also the recommended way of supporting live review
sessions, which could be otherwise tedious to arrange.

## Stratified

Online stratified selection can be seen as an alternative to predefining
reviewing schedule. The IFPR process allows the teacher to collect 
online performance data of the students and use this information
to make informed decisions in assigning reviewers. For example,
if the IFPR process allows students to give feedback on the reviews,
it possible to try to ensure that each student receives helpful
feedback by studying the past performance of the reviewers. Other
stratification schemes include  assigning
reviewers based on observed skill levels. This allows the teacher
to assing performant students as reviewers to the less performant
students or vice versa. We however note that deciding which
sort of pairing should be preferred over another is context
dependent (CITE Fincher&Petre) and it is not immedatedly clear
that the task performance is an indicator to performance as
a reviewer. (CITE Schunn)

## Market model

Assigning reviewers with a market scheme attaches external value on doing
reviews and cost to consuming the reviews.  This model awknowledges that
reviews are essentially a limited resource and that they have an innate
cost in time that the student can spend on other activities.

Besides being grounded on the reality markets can be seen as a way for
increasing student self-direction by allowing students to focus on doing
activities that are meaningful for them, such as spending their resources
to receive several additional reviews on a difficult part of the code,
perhaps leading to increased motivation.

However, the working group found several issues with the marked model.
First and foremost, introducing a market system creates a complex dynamic
system, one part of which is people, making it probable that even subtle
changes can produce significant and unexepected effects.  For example,
assigning market value to reviews can emphasise external motivation (CITE
Ryan&Deci, Klugg) on part of the students and de-emphasize the observed
benefits of giving reviews. Another concrete effect that was observed by
a working group member was that underlining the limitedness of the
resources caused students to instinctively conserving the resources to
their own disadvantage.  Further, the working group made note of a risk
of focusing student attention to the market dynamics instead of the
content taught. (CITE?) 

Applying market dynamics to the review process is possible but it must be
considered from the perspective of the culture in which the education
takes place and from the perspective of the educational philosophy
employed.

## Persistence as a modifier.

The in-flow process often requires multiple review tasks to be completed during
a single exercise, which gives rise to the design decision whether to make new
reviewer assignments at each review, or just once per exercise. It was observed
by (CITE CaptainTeach, if it was mentioned there) that switching reviewers in
mid assignment increased perceived student workloads, as the students need
to read several different assignments. To our knowledge fixing the assignments
has not been experimented within the in-flow process. We conjecture, that
it would lessen student workloads but that it also diminishes the variety
of the reviews and different ideas each student is exposed to. 

Persisting the reviewer over several steps also gives rise to host of other
potential problems, such as social problems between students and the
possibility of inequal pairings. Whether to use persistence is also 
related to the size of the exercise -- longer exercises that have more
review steps benefit more from persisting reviewers whereas shorter exercises
have less benefit.

Practitioner deciding to have persistence also needs to consider other 
effects, such as the requirement of anonymity when choosing this model.
