## Assigning Reviewers

Different ways of assigning reviewers can be used affect many aspects of the
IFPR process. For example, the review assignment process can have an effect on
student workload, the professional identity of the students, and performance of
minorities. Furthermore, the in-flow process requires the reviews to be done
promptly, which restricts the review assignment schemes to those that pose
light load on the students. Also, the review assignments must be observed from
two perspectives: from the perspective of the student receiving the review and
from the perspective of the reviewer, who is also seen as beneficiary of this
process. 

The working group identified 5 different assignment patterns that are
usable in this context. These patterns are:

1) **random**, where the available reviewers are randomly assigned,
2) **temporal order**, where the earliest answer without a review
   is assigned the first available reviewer,
3) **pre-defined**, where the review schedule is defined before the exercise,
4) **stratified**, where the reviewers are assigned according an external
   factor such as past performance, and the
5) **market model**, where students buy and sell reviews.

The review assignment schemes can be modified in two primary ways:

1) **persisting** the reviewer assignments so that same student reviews
   work of another throughout a single exercise, course or even a 
   semester, and having
2) **mutual reviews**, where student both reviews and receives reviews
   from the same peer.

Each of the assignment patterns represent different point in the design space
of in-flow review process. In the following sections, we discuss the benefits
and disadvantages that these patterns have.

### Random assignment
 
Random selections are the simplest method for reviewer assignment. In an
in-flow setting, however, random selections will be biased according to when
students submit their work. Those students who submit work early are more
likely to receive work to be reviewed from students who also submitted early.
This effect can be detrimental in some contexts and can be migitated with
intermediate deadlines that avoid biasing.

### Temporal order

Assigning reviewers by temporal order maximises the throughput
of the in-flow review system. 

(Note to Kathi, Joe and Shriram: you tried this with captain teach,
and we did not discuss it much during the WG. I think you might want 
to expand on this.)

### Predefined

Predefined review assignments can allow the IFPR practitioner to have a fixed
schedule, which can be used to ensure that ensures that reviews are assigned
evenly and that students can make a more effective use of their time outside of
the IFPR process.

Predefining the reviewer assignments also allows stratification of the review
process. For example, students can be paired according to their interests,
skill levels or any other such factor that is known before the course.  If live
review sessions are planned, the recommended way of arranging them is to
schedule them early on.  On the negative side, predefined schedule can be more
fragile in face of changes, such students leaving the course.

### Stratified

Online stratified selection can be seen as an alternative to predefining
reviewing schedule. The IFPR process allows the teacher to collect
data on student performance and this information can be used to make informed
decisions in assigning reviewers. For example, if the IFPR process employed allows
students to give feedback on the reviews, it possible to try to ensure that
each student receives helpful feedback by matching students that have been helpful
reviewers with those students who have not received quality feedback.  

Other stratification schemes include assigning reviewers to authors based on their
observed skill levels. This allows the teacher to assign performant students to
review to the less performant students or vice versa. We however note that
deciding which sort of pairing should be preferred over another is context
dependent (CITE Fincher&Petre).  It is also not clear that the task
performance is an indicator to performance as a reviewer. (CITE Schunn)

### Market model

Assigning reviewers with a market scheme attaches an external benefit on
writing reviews and an external cost to consuming the reviews.  This model
acknowledges that reviews are essentially a limited resource and that they have
an innate cost in time that the student can spend on other activities.

Besides being grounded on the reality, market schemes can be seen as a way for
increasing student self-direction by allowing students to focus on activities
that are meaningful for them. As an example, student may spend their resources
to receive additional reviews on a difficult parts of the course, which can
increase performance and motivation.

However, the working group found several issues with the marked model.
First and foremost, introducing review markets creates a complex dynamic
system, one part of which is people, making it probable that even subtle
changes can produce significant and unexpected effects.  For example,
assigning market value to reviews can emphasise external motivation (CITE
Ryan&Deci, Klugg) on part of the students and de-emphasize the observed
benefits of giving reviews. Another concrete effect that was observed by
a working group member was that underlining the limitedness of the
resources can cause students to instinctively conserve their resources to
their own disadvantage.  Further, the working group made note of a risk
of focusing student attention to the market dynamics instead of the
course content. (CITE?) 

In summary, applying market dynamics to the review process is feasible but
doing so must be considered from the perspective of the culture in which the
education takes place and from the perspective of the educational philosophy
employed.

### Persistence as a modifier

The in-flow process often requires multiple review tasks to be completed during
a single exercise, which gives rise to the design decision whether to make new
reviewer assignments at each review, or just once per exercise. It was observed
by (CITE CaptainTeach, if it was mentioned there) that switching reviewers
during the same exercise led to increased student workloads, as the students
needed to familiarize themselves several different submissions.  We conjecture,
persisting the same reviewer over a whole exericse could lessen student
workloads but that it could also diminishes the variety of the reviews each
student is exposed to. 

Persisting the reviewer over several exercise stages gives rise to several
potential problems in social interactions between students. If collaborative
cheating is an issue in the context where IFPR is applied, persisting the
reviewers must also be carefully considered. Persistence also limits the 
the choices of how to implement anonymity.

Benefits of persistence are also related to the size of the exercise --
longer exercises that have more stages can benefit more from persisting
reviewers than shorter exercises.
