# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

No, but that's because we are already doing things similarly.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

It is unclear what intermediate stage 1 is about. Presumably you are already giving them some kind of maze data structure (because how else will you be able to grade at scale?). Assuming that is true, they are only developing auxilliary data structures they need _for their implementation_, so they can't know what those will be in stage 1 -- these will only become apparent later.

Similarly, the peer review part for stage 1 is not clear enough.

Finally, the rubric does not seem like a good match with all the stages.

# Any other comments on course structure?

None, looks good!

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

N/A
