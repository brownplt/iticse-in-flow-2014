# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

Ditto.

# Any other comments on course structure?

1. I had not seen this particular data structure before -- I like it!

2. One criticism: you say that the goal of this assignment is to have students do recursive programming but with some efficiency in mind. However, the rubric doesn't seem to mention this at all. This seems like an oversight, because one would expect the rubric to be consistent with the assignment's goals.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
