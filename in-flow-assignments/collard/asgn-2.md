# Assignment Name
Maze Solver

## Course Context

This is a sophmore level computer science course titled Programming Methodology.

At this point, the majority of students have taken Introduction to Programming in Java and a course covering Object Oriented Data Structures in Java.

In this course, most students will be seeing Scala and functional programming for the first time.

## Assignment

Students will be asked to write a maze solver using a variant of Dijkstra's
algorithm. Given a list of directions, an actor moves through the maze. If the
actor hits a wall, it dies. In addition to basic MOVE directions there will also
be TURN directions which will require additional information to be stored while
traversing the graph.

## Educational Goals

Reason about Graphs in Scala aswell as transforming Dijkstra's to accomodate
their needs.

## Intermediate Stages

1. Write a datatypes / functions for constructing a Maze
2. Write a datatypes / functions for traversing a Maze
3. Write a function that produces a list of directions that successfully traverses a Maze

## Stage Submissions

This is a one week assignment. Stages 1 and 2 will be due together 4 days into
the week and stage 3 will be due at the end of the week.

## Peer Review

Students will review 2 - 3 other students submissions for stages 1 and 2. If the
datatypes are not defined with all of the information needed to produce a valid
solution, they can get feedback that will help them when they are trying to
produce the solver.

Possible Rubric:

* Are the construction functions correct? If not, provide examples where they do not work.

* Are the traversal functions correct? If not, provide examples where they do not work.

## Expert Review

None.
