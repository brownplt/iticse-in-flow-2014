I see a risk of the peer feedback turning out a bit shallow: just yes/"no" (resp. line number) answers to the expert's questions. The comment box seems like an optional add-on rather than the (what I feel could be) the most useful aspect of the feedback.
Thus, the student who receives the reviews will not really learn much more than if they had just received the questions (and answered them themselves).
And the student who had to perform the review didn't really have much freedom (and thus responsibility) in producing thoughtful reviews.

Generally I guess test-driven development is well suited for in-flow peer review: first write tests, then get feedback, then write the implementation, then (maybe) get feedback on that.

The idea of allowing students to revise their test suite based on feedback looks promising. Would there be more feedback coming on the revised suite?

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
