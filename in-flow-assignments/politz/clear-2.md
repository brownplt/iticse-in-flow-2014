A role for test driven development could be considered
# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?
While the reviews in this assignment are graded I wondered about the criteria for their grading.  Will this automated assessment cover all constructive review feedback?  Especially since qualitative comments are not graded.
# Any other comments on course structure?
is there a weakenss in an automatic grading on tests passed appraoch - I know some of our students who hard coded their solutions to meet the test output goals?  Further is there no credit for quality of design or style (readability, maintainability etc.) of either tests or implementation ?
# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
under grading typo "or..." should read "for accuracy..."?
BYU needs expansion for an international readership
