Sounds like a great assignment! I like how each stage refines the solution of the original problem, so that the peer feedback really can affect subsequent stages.

If the expert produces a grade, couldn't that grader also provide something more useful than just a grade (i.e., an expert review)? Even if just at the end of the process?

Could students explicitly assess the helpfulness of the reviews they receive? (to make it more obvious which reviews are most helpful)

Step 3: "the reviews for step 2 must be submitted before this step is submitted": does that mean that a student does not have the step 2 reviews at the time they start working on step 3? If yes, why?

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
