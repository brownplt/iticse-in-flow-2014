# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?
This looks like a nice way to get students to think about the issues in designing secure software, by highlighting techniques and strategies that a hacker might employ and thereby motivate good design.  The practical counter case provides a good context for consdering the reasosn for secure design. This could also apply to other more general SE design scenarios, refactoring, documentation etc. 
I'm not sure of the blind review stage, but could this being of use in some situations
# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?
I like the outline that students must give of their strategies and actvities in stages 1 and 2, in a sense it is a little like an experimental log book and models good approaches to demonstrating the scientific method and steps performed
# Any other comments on course structure?
I like the way it builds and forces students to reflect, debate and justify a collective strategy built upon some prior empirical work of their own
# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
Is there any canonical solution to the problem, or are there any number of valid strategies.  It is not entirely clear how students have a sense of their target outcome?  I also wondered to what extent this is a language and environment/platform agnostic assignment?
