# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Make them more fun by using real world data.

Plan in more precise detail the planning of all stages.

Borrow the rubric: coherence and correctness â€“ similar to what I wrote, though more to-the-point.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

Include in the final submission how peer-review comments were addressed.

Use a checklist to ensure that students actually participate in the peer-reviewing, whilst avoiding
the problems of grading peer-review and intermediate submissions (mentioned in Krishnamurthi.2).

# Any other comments on course structure?

If intermediate stages are not assessed, how can we guarantee that students actually submit something
and participate. (Perhaps a checklist of things that need to be done, without a grade, as used in
Clarke.2).

The expert review phase was good. Little effort, mainly used for quality assurance. Similar to Clarke.2,
but offline.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

The very last point, while interesting, is unrelated to peer review.
