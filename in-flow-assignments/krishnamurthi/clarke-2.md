# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Provide detailed descriptions of the intermediate deliverables, rather than just "whatever you have 2 weeks before deadline".

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

Ensuring that intermediate phases and feedback are submitted and of an okay level without grading,
using a kind of checklist.

# Any other comments on course structure?

Student time management becomes an issue, with 3 intermediate stages, where each student is expected to review 3 other assignments. Ouch! This is further exacerbated by the fact that the intermediate stages can be submitted at any time. Students will get wildly out of sync. Early submitters will not get feedback from late submitters (and vice versa), thereby defeating the purpose of the whole venture.

Keeping the same reviewer for all 3 phases could be problematic for a number of reasons: no benefit from getting same bad reviewers, if reviewers vanish you don't get reviews (only half the story is given in the text),  

The comment about there being lots of room for interpretation in the assignment can be the key to avoiding or reducing cheating. Each student/group will set out on a different path, thereby resulting in different solutions, and making cheating more pointless or more at least more traceable.

The size of specifications makes them easier to work with. Love it!

Point about not grading either intermediate phases and feedback is interesting and deserves debate. 
How does one actually ensure that students submit something worthwhile? (Clarke.2 has some ideas.)

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Some of the characteristics of "specifications" that make them ideal for peer review could be generalised into a set of guidelines.
