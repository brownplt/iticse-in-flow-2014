# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Yes. I have felt frustrated by having students only turn in code. I have wanted to have some notion of "plans" included as well, in my case, test plans. I'm inspired by this assignment, which essentially does just that.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

It is unclear that it can be improved per se. However, I do think there are too many phases of review. I think students may get a bit fatigued by it. It is also unclear how live reviewing will play into this: to some extent it will reduce fatigue (because people are interacting socially, not just staring into monitors), but it might make things worse after a little (because it's hard to schedule face-to-face time, things might get more confrontational, it ceases to be "fun", etc.).

# Any other comments on course structure?

To reduce the need for full student buy-in, I suggest just doing two steps of this assignment with IFPR. Pick the one or two that are both

* critical, and

* most review-artifact-friendly

and focus on those. If students have a good experience there, they will buy into IFPR more naturally.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

The writing is excellent. Presumably the final section will be updated eventually. My only nit is this: the singular of "criteria" is "criterion" (-: ["the first criteria"].
