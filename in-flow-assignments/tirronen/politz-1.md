# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

This led me to the idea that one way to review one another's work is to
generate inputs (in this case, attacks) for other students.  For the
type-checker assignment in our programming languages course, finding an
unsound case in the type system is similar to "attacking" the type system.  It
could be interesting to explicitly include in the code review the opportunity
for students to whitebox test the type-checker against programs designed to
demonstrate unsoundness.

"Compare what is different from your solution" is a useful prompt that could
be used for a lot of programming assignments, and I would consider including
expicitly.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

My assignments had an emphasis on student-written tests.  Can students create
tests that reliably check if their application has regressed on a particular
security issue?  I think this is actually a pretty hard problem, but this kind
of assignment would be a place to try it, and would give a concrete artifact
for review and prompting "Can you think of ways to make a mistake in the
program that would introduce a security issue that these tests wouldn't
catch?"

# Any other comments on course structure?

I can think of a peer review stage --- attack one anothers' applications!
Then students can see if they found all the attacks in their own application
that others found.  This might take a little more time, but it seems like a
really fun form of review.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
