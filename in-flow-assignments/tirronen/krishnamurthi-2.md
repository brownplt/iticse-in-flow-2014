# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Again, I like the idea of submitting higher-level plans. In this case, it's the subdivision plan: a plan composition for the problem.

It would be interesting to discuss this in the context of plan-composition studies that Kathi Fisler has begun doing and that we are looking to do much more extensively starting next year.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

I don't think IFPR is needed for stage 4. A student should be able to run their own tests. (Running one person's tests against another person's code is a differentÂ matter, also worth discussing: we call it TestFest.) I would instead spend that time on step 1. If they can't even tell good tests from bad, maybe they haven't even understood the _problem_, which means they should be proceeding to subsequent steps!

# Any other comments on course structure?

I found the course structure rather curious. Would like to hear more about how this works in person at the WG.

In terms of flagging hostile comments, etc., perhaps you would be interested in our Captain Teach framework, which will provide built-in support for such things.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Definitely needs some proof-reading.
