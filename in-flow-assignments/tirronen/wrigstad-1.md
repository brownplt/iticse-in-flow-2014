# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

I really like the reviewing part of how the design has changed as
a consequence of "securing the program". I would like to include
similar reflection steps in my assigments.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

It is unclear to me that grading based on effort alone is the
right thing to do. Maybe students who are able to show that they
understand what they are doing or should have been doing can be
rewarded for insights rather than effort? 

Also, there may be too many steps in a single pipeline. If a
student fails at some point (for any reason), she will have a hard
time getting back into the game, at least it seems like that to
me. Maybe there ways could be created to getting back into the
game later, for example by taking over some old project from
another year?

# Any other comments on course structure?

I sounds very solid and inspiring!

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Some broken language.
