# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

I like the idea of having an explicit suggestion in test review step to adapt
others' tests for your own implementation.  We wondered if students were doing
that in our course, and it might be useful to just *tell* them to do it, when
there's obvious value they can get out of it.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

Put some of the testing earlier.  This forces students to confront some of the
problems from step 2, because they will have to write tests in terms of the
data structures they are designing, and will find if they've missed anything
major before they dive into the main act of programming.

Some of the tests could go along with the submissions for step 2, and part of
the review could be the reviewer describing if they think the proposed testing
plan will work.

# Any other comments on course structure?

I agree with the comment at the bottom that it's hard to put these design
exercises too early before the code, especially with students who may not be
trained enough to understand the value of the design.  I would be interested
in seeing the plan for splitting up the programming phase, and how that might
get reviewed, too.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
