# Assignment Name

Drawing a Self-Portrait

## Course Context

Most students are sophomore- or junior- level art students who have taken basic drawing and form classes in their first year, and are moving on to more focused courses.  This assignment is given in a course on drawing anatomically realistic figures.

## Assignment

Draw a self-portrait on paper with pencil

## Educational Goals

Practice conveying emotion in drawing, practice
correct rendering of human facial anatomy

## Intermediate Stages

2-3 preliminary sketches illustrating different
possible emotions in your portrait.

## Stage Submissions

Preliminary sketches should be brought to class the week
before the assignment is due.

## Peer Review

Students will be broken into small groups.  Each group
will hang all of its sketches on the wall and discuss them
collectively.  Students will be asked to discuss which emotions each
sketch conveys and which are being conveyed effectively.  Students
will be asked to identify strong and weak representations of anatomy
across the group's set of sketches.

Students will be asked to leave their work unsigned, and try to not observe who is putting up which piece.

## Expert Review

After all the peers are done, the instructor will select a handful of works from each piece for evaluation. Typically, the instructor will try to choose pieces that represent a broad spectrum of expert opinion, and/or highlight especially interesting characteristics. The instructor will also work to minimize conflict and discomfort, while still emphasizing the ultimately subjective nature of reception of portraiture as preparation for the students' eventual experience in the world of art.

## Grading

Students will submit their sketches and the final portrait
for grading.  Grades will weigh the final portrait at 80%, and
improvements from the sketches to the portrait at 20%.

## Thoughts

This seems a bit passive.  It would be great to find a way
to have students critique each other's processes for coming up with
portrait ideas.
