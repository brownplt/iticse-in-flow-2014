# Assignment Name

Programming 1 - Marked Exercise A
## Course Context

The course is a CS1 objects early course using Bluej and java

## Assignment

The assignment requires students to create objects and call methods, add fields and simple methods to a class

## Educational Goals

After this set of exercises students will be able to:
•	Create objects using the BlueJ class and object bench
•	Call methods using the BlueJ object bench
•	Call a method that requires an object as a parameter using the BlueJ object bench
•	Zip and submit a file

## Intermediate Stages

This group of tasks is one in a set of 5 exercises cumulatively bulding in scope and difficulty.  While a succesful method call might be seen as an intermediate step at a micro level, completion of the group of tasks for exercise A is a better intermediate step which could be reviewed as a whole prior to starting exercise B.  



## Stage Submissions

Students are given a simple Bluej project to begin with.  A zip file with the project code, and a  word document containing 2 screenshots (of output printed to screen and a Bluej screen) are submitted at the end of the exercise

## Peer Review

currently there is no peer review although it could be incorporated

## Expert Review

The exercises are currently graded by Teaching assistants or lecturer 

## Grading

prior to completing the marked sets of exercises, students must complete and have signed off a set of lab tasks (which are formative zero weighted activities) 

The exercises fall within the grading schedule below

Assignment 1  | Marked Exercise A 	|9 March	        |10
Assignment 2  | Marked Exercise B	  |30 March	        |20
Assignment 3  | Marked Exercise C	  |11 May	          |20
In-Lecture Quiz	                    |Fortnightly	    |10
Final Examination 		                                |40

Total                                                 |100

	Correctly changes the type of currency
6.	Add a satisfactionRating field
	data type int
	private field
	Named correctly
	Initialised to 100

## Thoughts

Pair programming could usefully augment this assessment scheme, as could the use of peerwise.  Some equivalent to code inspections that might work for such simple pieces of code would be a good idea too, perhaps conducted in groups or by the whole  class in a smallish closed lab session.
