This is a canonical in-flow peer-review task, and similar to several we have done, though our split between the stages is quite different. We should discuss this during the WG.

I certainly agree that pair programming and code reviews are both useful here, and each of these three techniques is orthogonal to the other. Just as a matter of terminology, since "code inspection" seems to mean different things to different people, it might be helpful to spell out what model of code inspection the author has in mind. 

Would you have the peers use the same rubric as the course staff? I think that would be especially good to do, because seeing someone else's code through the lens of layout, programming standards, etc. is sure to inspire the students to do better on their own work. However, "project compiles" can be done automatically and hence perhaps peers should not be burdened with this step.

Students often fail to understand rubric elements like layout and programming standards. Some students will be wise enough to go to course staff and ask for help assessing such things, while others will blindly provide weak or even faulty reviews. Therefore, it seems vital for the course staff to take a quick look at these reviews and intervene when they think they are problematic, lest a student who is doing well but lacks confidence, etc., get sidetracked by the reviews and make a good solution into a bad one!
