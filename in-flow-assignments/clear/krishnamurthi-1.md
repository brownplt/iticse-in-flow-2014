# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

This is a great exercise for peer-review. I especially like that part of my motivation in thinking about peer-review was to emulate the "conference" model (especially with a response phase), and this takes that literally, down to using EasyChair.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

Not directly.

# Any other comments on course structure?

Mechanically, it is a little unclear how easy it will be to configure EasyChair to support this kind of reviewing. I wonder if the author has considered this. 

There seem to be numerous phases here, and it appears there will be peer review after every single phase. That might be quite onerous, especially as the length of the article keeps growing, so will the length of the document the peers need to review. I worry about a possible decline in quality over time.

Will the same peers be used over and over? There is a trade-off between repeating and not repeating reviewers (with fairly obvious trade-offs, that I expect we will take about more in person at the WG). For the purposes of this exercise, I simply bring this up as something the author should consider.

I wonder whether it makes complete sense to use the _exact_ same rubric for the instructors as for the peers. While we do want the peers to behave like professionals (especially in a course like this, which is at the graduate level and getting students to do things professionals do), there might still be some things you want each to focus on that you would not expect of the other. In particular, we do not expect instructors to engage in a "reflective" practice when grading, while we might expect that of the peers. We (presumably) hope that reading the work of others helps students improve their own. While these improvements will be implicitly reflected in their next drafts, would you like some explicit reflection from them? Going in the other direction, might you want the students to do a little less work (and perhaps be a bit less thorough) than the instructors, given that they have so much else to do?

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

A little more writing detail would help.
