Research Project

## Course Context

The course is a Masters level course in Collaborative Computing.  Students should typically have completed a prior undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems or Computer Engineering.  The student body is typically diverse with a range of local and international students, so assumptions of prior knowledge can be tricky. 

## Assignment

Collaboratively produce a research article based on analysis of available primary data from a series of international collaborative trials and using an analytical framework selected from a list prescribed.

## Educational Goals

To develop skills in research and academic writing based upon linkage of a selected framework(s) from the collaborative computing literature, personal exploration and observations of collaborative trial processes, data and outcomes;

To gain insight into the peer review and quality assurance processes for research publications and by participating in those processes as both collaborative contributor and reviewer, produce a sound and credible research article;

To examine the theories and concepts related to collaborative computing, shared workspaces, workflow applications, group decision support, global virtual teams, web-based groupware, the supporting technologies and emerging trends.

## Expert Review

Expert review of the proposal submission by the course lecturer/instructor is conducted by draft submission, reading and critique by the lecturer with feedback delivered through a face to face interview against the elements of an indicative process flow diagram (summarised in the list below).


* **Determine a research question**: Decide what is the focus of your study, and what do you want to know at the end of it?

* **Select a Research framework**:  Typically this will be a conceptual framework of some kind, through which you can guide your analysis.  For instance in educational studies, taxonomies for learning such as Bloom or SOLO may be candidate frameworks.

* **Investigate and Identify Research Data Sources**: Determine what data you have available to support your analysis, and whether it is likely to be appropriate for answering your research question.  

* **Apply Data Analysis Technique**: There are many research methods texts which may assist here.  Common techniques for analyzing textual data include thematic or content analysis, and for numerical data a variety of statistical techniques such as regression or Chi squared tests may clarify patterns of relationships and differences in data.  Choice of these techniques will need to be related back to the research framework (e.g. if questionnaire data is available based upon an established research instrument, then statistical techniques can be applied against known and validated constructs) 

* **Synthesise and Draw Conclusions**: Here is where the study findings are all drawn together, and the analysis moves from description or tabulation of phenomena, to a more holistic, critical and abstracted view.  Essentially here we are assessing: what insights does the study offer, or what do the findings mean? Do they answer the originally posed research question? Was it capable of being answered or does it need to be modified? What contribution does this study make, and for whom? 


Expert review of each draft submission by the course lecturer/instructor is conducted in the same manner as that performed by their peers, using the reviewing rubric above.


## Grading

Each student (or student pairs’) two reviews at each cycle (four in total) are summatively assessed, applying the guidelines below


### PARTICIPATION AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES 


Note: assessment will be based upon completion, timeliness and value of contributions


(How) Will this assessment impact the final score
on the assignment?


Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment.


Student peer reviews contribute up to 24% to the final grade


The final summatively assessed article (produced by an individual or a pair) contributes 76% of the grade


### QUALITY OF THE ARTICLE (BASED UPON REVIEW CRITERIA) (76%)


Note: late article draft submissions which impact upon review or assessment deadlines will result in the deduction of penalty marks


A final poster session enables the gaining of up to 10% bonus marks


### RESEARCH POSTER PRESENTATION (10%)


Note: Poster assessment criteria will be based on content and presentation of poster and ability of both authors to explain and justify the conclusions.


## Thoughts


1.  Given the collaborative pedagogical model and the necessity of commitment to
    the continual activity demanded in the course students are requested to
    complete a learning agreement making this understanding explicit


    ```
    Learning Agreement for the Collaborative Computing Research Project


    Undertaking by the Student to Support the Learning of Colleagues


    The design of the Collaborative Computing and Workflow course inherently
    demands a mutual commitment to collaboration on the part of the
    participants.  Therefore the performance of an individual student in the
    course has an impact on the performance of others.  When working as a
    member of a pair it is doubly important to consider the needs of your
    colleague.  This learning agreement outlines the undertakings made by each
    student to actively participate in this process by strictly adhering to
    deadlines for the submission of drafts and reviews (or in the case of
    unavoidable and unforeseeable events, to promptly notify those impacted and
    provide indicative dates by which the affected task will be completed) 

    I (student name and id)…………………………………………………………………………


    Date: ……………………………

    Hereby agree that I will:

    adhere strictly to the submission deadlines outlined for the series of
    article drafts, and reviews required for this research project in the event
    of unavoidable or unforeseeable events, show courtesy by promptly notifying
    those impacted by any delay on my part.  This notification will include the
    fact of any delay and a date by which it may be rectified through
    submission of the affected work item. 

    Note: This page is to be completed and handed in to your lecturer by the
    end of the Wednesday evening session 25th August
    ```


2. This is a demanding course for both students and teachers, but can be very
    rewarding and can produce excellent work.  Given the number of pieces of
    assessment to review, it would not scale to much beyond the 36 students in the
    last occurrence which I taught, unless a team teaching model were adopted.  It
    is also important to combine the expert review with the peer review so students
    are not penalised by poor reviews from less capable colleagues.  Some students
    do not culturally value the opinions of their peers, so that can be a hurdle
    too. 


    Introducing the optional final poster session with scope for bonus marks
    resulted in the only case in which I have seen more than three quarters of
    the course turn up and present and share their work in a true commitment to
    mutual learning.  So the collaborative spirit seemed to have sunk in.
