# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Especially for "updater", the idea of designing a presentation around the
program could be valuable.  I might have the students present it in a
medium-sized group, or in front of the whole class, in order to get a
different kind of feedback than they get anonymously on their code.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

One thing that the updater assignment does is break a larger program into
smaller pieces for review.  If the students' programs are too long to review
on their own, it may be possible to have students submit the program in
several stages or distill out other reviewable artifacts.  For example,
because the course is concerned with design patterns and abstractions,
students could submit a skeleton of the classes and interfaces (with no
implementation) for review before or along with their program.

# Any other comments on course structure?

Having students pick learning goals is a really nice idea.  It addresses the
problem of having to remind students what they've learned (which they may not
really pay attention to anyway), by putting the responsibility to acknowledge
it in their hands.

What proportion of the available programming assignments do the students do?
Does a student end up doing most of them by the time the course is through,
only 10%?  I'm curious about the amount of choice available to the students in
picking assignments, and the amount of training required for course staff to
understand them all.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Are their any programs that are particularly well- or badly-suited to breaking
up into stages?  Is the suitedness of a program for breaking up into stages in
any way related to which learning goals it addresses?
