# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

I like the idea of randomly reviewing peer review as a TA.  Since it's random,
it's tricky to make it count for a grade, but it does give some expert help to
students.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

Not really.

# Any other comments on course structure?

When the review is a "discussion", do you imagine it being between two
students or a larger group?  Is the discussion face to face or electronic?

I'm surprised you feel uninspired, because this breakdown is roughly how we
did things in our courses, and we thought it was really valuable!

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
