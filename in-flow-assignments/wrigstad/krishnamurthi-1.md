# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

The idea of explicitly tying assignments to a set of educational goals, and in particular what appear to be "micro-goals".

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

I suspect concretizing some of these details would help; on the other hand, perhaps it is intentional to leave so many decisions in the hands of students, providing only meta-rules instead.

Also, providing at least a little evaluation of the in-flow peer-review would be wise until it is clear that students are self-motivated to do it well, and do in fact do a good job of it. Otherwise, students might be mislead by bad feedback and thus do worse than if there had been no use of in-flow peer-review (though there is something to be said about getting used to incorrect feedback, too).

# Any other comments on course structure?

If I understand it correctly, I like how much power this puts in student hands, but I wonder if it gives them too much freedom (aka, too long a rope to hang themselves with). I can see really smart students doing a fantastic job of this but weak students really struggling. I look forward to learning more about this style of course structure at the WG.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

I wonder if it would be possible to concretize this more, or at least make clear that things really are intended to be at this level of abstraction.
