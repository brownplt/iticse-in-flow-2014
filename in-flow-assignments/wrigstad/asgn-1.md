# Assignment Name

Snappy codename: "Achievement 1"

Any assignment in the course Imperative and Object-Oriented
Programming and Programming Methodology.


## Course Context

2nd year programming course teaching imperative and
object-oriented programming to students who know how to program in
ML in a functional style. About 50% know imperative programming
from extra-curricular activities, but not all. 


## Assignment

In this couse, students are given a huge list of educational
goals, and must complete these goals in terms of a number of
programming assignments that they can choose from. Mapping
educational goals to programs and building coherent packages of
educational goals are part of the problem. A key idea is to put
learning front and center, and not as a side-effect of having
written a certain program.


## Educational Goals

A set of 3-5 goals from a list of 77. Sadly, I only have this list
in Swedish, or I would have linked to it. For concreteness, we can
assume the following goals:

1. Use OO abstraction to hide implementation details behind
   well-defined interfaces. 
2. Use inheritance, method specialisation and super calls in 
   programs that use inheritance. 
3. Explain how inheritance can be used to separate concerns. 
4. Define loop-invariants for some important loops in a program
   and reason about their correctness
5. Describe a class' class invariants and reason about how 
   encapsulation helps protecting these invariants

We can imagine that students choose to implement this as part of a
MUD assignment in which they build a small MUD based on a map of
the department with professors roaming the halls, etc. 


## Intermediate Stages

1. Select a number of educational goals that build a coherent package.
2. Choose a program to implement that encompasses these goals. 
3. Design the program. 
4. Implement the program. 
5. Design a presentation flow that shows how the goals are met. 
6. Hold the presentation before an examiner. 

## Stage Submissions

Peer-review could be used to feedback on the selection of goals
(do these goals really belong together), and the selection of a
program in the implementation of which these goals will be met.
Sometimes, students are already working on a program and want to
select more goals. If a document is produced detailing how the
goals should be met by the program they are implementing, this
would be a good case for peer-review.

Clearly, the design of the program (although not part of the
educational goals in this example) could be a good case for
peer-review. 

The implementation of the program could also be peer-reviewed,
although I suspect that this is too large a chunk and would be
needed to be broken down some more to pay off in practise.

The presentation outline that students develop to drive the oral
presentation before the examiner of why/how they fulfill the goals


## Peer Review

Focusing on intermediate steps 1 and 2 above. Student always work
in pairs. The peer review should be done by one other pair group.
Let's call the pair doing the assigment work P1 and the review
pair P2. P2 will recieve informal written documentation explaining
the goals chosen by P1 and how that maps to some programming task
they have chosen. P2 will deliver a more formal document
(following some template given by teachers) that
discusses/criticises P1's choices, and makes alternate
suggestions. It could be that this feedback is delievered in
person, with a TA present. (Cf Grading below.)


## Expert Review

Cf Grading below. The Expert is in this case a TA or teacher on
the course.


## Grading

The goal system in this course is partially trying to quantify the
qualitative aspects of the grading process, so everything is
pass-fail and instead goals are on different grade levels. 

Regularly during the course, students come together in smaller
groups of about 10-12 people. These groups are the logical units
for the in-flow peer assessment, and during these meetings, it
makes sense to make the assessment if everyone involved is in the
same room. (4 out of 8-12 people present.) 

The use of in-flow peer assessment should preferably be integrated
in the goal system at different levels required so that students
get to "tick something off" as a reward for good peer review. (Or
not, if the job was not well done.) 

The person running this meeting could ask the students who did the
peer review to summarise their thoughts and then ask the other
students how the selection of goals worked out in practise, for
example (I am focusing on intermediate stages 1-2). 

## Thoughts

Above, I do the grading of the in-flow peer review at the end.
Maybe that's wrong, but if we focus on feedbacking on help that
towards an already fullfilled goal, then we can hopefully focus
more on the help, and less on the (fulfilled) goals. I think that
we want to build up a culture using in-flow peer review, and that
the process and the help should be its own reward.
