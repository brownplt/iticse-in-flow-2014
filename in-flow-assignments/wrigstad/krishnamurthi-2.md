# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Once again, I like this more self-directed approach towards attaining mastery. Would like to discuss it more at the WG.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

I think the author already correctly recognizes the fatigue that is caused by having too many intermediate stages. Otherwise, this is very similar to what we have been doing a few times (we can discuss this more at the WG).

Step 3: why not concrete testing code (perhaps in addition to a plan -- another thing to discuss at the WG)?

I'm unsure why this is "uninspiring". I would certainly like to hear more given how similar this is to what we're doing! Would like to talk about this at the WG. Either:

* the author isn't realizing virtues to this process, or
* we're not seeing some things the author does,

and either way should be instructive!

# Any other comments on course structure?

None.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Maybe a little more fleshing out of details, but otherwise, it's fine.
