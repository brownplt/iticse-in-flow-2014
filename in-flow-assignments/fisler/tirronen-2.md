# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

I did not consider limiting the peer review to a part of the exercise like done
here. If I did so, the exercises might be easier to arrange. Further, I like
how the students are made to explicitly _analyse_ (cf. observe) a topic that is
known to be difficult. If successful, this could result in deeper learning than
what would otherwise take place and it seems more cognitively aligned with
goals of higher education.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

I don't think that I have any novel ideas that could be applied here.

# Any other comments on course structure?

The most interesting part (for me) in the exercise is focusing the peer reviews
on the part which is most unfamiliar to the students. I think this makes
students consider this part more thoroughly but I find that it also raises a
danger of the reviews being bad due to inexperience. This danger can probably
be alleviated by taking it in account when lecturing the topic.

Also, I think that formal models can be very nice topic to make exercises for
as it is easy to conceive automated checking for them. Do you plan on having
any? Could it stand in the place of human expert reviews?

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Again, the process includes a very little expert review and like in my
exercises, it seems difficult to include the student review process in the
grading.  Perhaps the success during review process and success in the
exercises themselves are too separate concerns to be mixed in the grading?

Also, I would take a note how this exercise applies peer review to focuse
higher order thought processes to a topic that is unfamiliar for the students.
