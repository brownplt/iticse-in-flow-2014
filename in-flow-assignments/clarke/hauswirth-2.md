I like the idea of reserving 1/3 of the peer review session for discussion. Would this be guided by a TA/instructor? (Ah, this is answered under the "Expert Review" section -- it might make sense to pull the fact that experts moderate the meeting up to "Peer Review" section).

WRT the peer review rubric, could it help to also allow specific comments (instead of a "summative" boolean/counting result, point out which elements were good or bad, why they were good or bad, and how they could be improved)?

Why not make all submissions mandatory?

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
