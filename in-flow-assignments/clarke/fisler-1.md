# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

I hadn't thought about using TAs to grade feedback in the early
rounds, but that seems an interesting idea that might improve feedback
in later rounds.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

The questions allow yes/no answers, which allows students to be a bit
sloppy.  Should they be asked to provide specific examples/test cases
to illustrate failed correctness or failed adherence to the spec?

# Any other comments on course structure?

I can't decide whether having two reviews from the same pair decreases
diversity of expected feedback, gives a useful basis for educational
studies, or is in general a good or bad idea.  Something interesting
to think about.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

I'm curious about the rubric question "does the specification make
sense" -- is the specification something the students are submitting?
If so, what does it look like?

Also curious how grading on the overall assignment interacts with the
intermediate deadlines: can students revise work based on the first
peer-reviews?  How will you balance the original and revised work in
computing grades?
