# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?
I also should consider the use of rubrics.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

# Any other comments on course structure?
These comments are not really comparing my assignment to this assignment, thus I place them here:

What do the passing students do while the failing students attend the tutorial and redo the failed assignment?

The two-week assignments would only have one intermediate step. Is that an issue?

Would the functions to be submitted at each stage be selected by the instructor, or could students select them?

If the assignment is broken down into independent smaller assignments (e.g., sets of functions to specify or implement), and if each smaller assignment is evaluated independently, then there might not be much of an "in-flow" flavor left. I mean there wouldn't be much of a chance to *revise* the submission to incorporate the feedback.

Turn-around time: Could one make the time available for providing feedback relatively short? Also, during the feedback phase, all students are busy providing feedback, so turn-around time may be less of an issue.

Misleading feedback indeed seems to be a general issue with peer feedback. The main solution may be to require feedback from multiple students (like we do that for peer reviews for our research papers). A side benefit of this is that the receiving student will learn to deal with partially conflicting feedback. Another solution could be calibration: asking evaluators to grade an example assignment and then showing them the grades given by instructors. 

Are numerical grades (even when driven by rubrics) the most effective? Wouldn't free-form comments be more helpful?

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
