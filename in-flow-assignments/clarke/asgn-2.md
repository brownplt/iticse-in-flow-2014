# Assignment Name

Advanced Dungeons and Design (AD&D)

## Course Context

This assigment is the only assessment for the fourth year/first masters course
_Advanced Software Design_. The course is offered to a of CS, IT and 
other interested students. Students are required to have roughly 2 years worth
of CS units under the belt, including a second year course on object-oriented
programming. 

The course is essentially about object-oriented design, software architecture, design patterns, refactoring,
UML, and it is the first course in which they do a largish design project.

Students learn (or receive a refresher) on iterative development methods,
some principles of good (OO) design, design evaluation and refactoring.
Design evaluation and  improvement -- essentially feedback and responding
to feedback -- are key features of the course.

Although the course is about design, assessment is not based (exclusively) on the quality of
students' final designs. Instead, students need to tick of a list of goals related to various
aspects of design. Students tick goals off by performing some design work 
(fleshing out an architecture, employing design patterns, etc),
and then convincing TAs that the work they have done and the understanding they 
have gained satisfy the selected goal. Goals are partitioned according to
the possible grades students may obtain (3, 4, 5). In order to get a particular grade,
students need to tick off all goals for that grade (and lower grades). 
Goals are designed so that students electing to tick off a particular grade 5 goal,
can also tick off the corresponding grade 3 and 4 goals at the same time. In addition,
students can group goals together to reduce their overall workload. This ultimately
requires that students reflect on their work and plan their own assessment.

Students work in teams and typically tick off goals in teams, but students may opt
out or may be judged by the TA to inadequately satisfy the goal. There are no free-riders.

Some of the goals are related to teamwork, evaluating designs and providing feedback,
and acting upon feedback given.


## Assignment

Students are given a detailed description of a Dungeon-based board game and they are required
to design and implement (in part) a mobile-app+server based on this description, following 
an iterative development methodology.
The key documents students receive are a description of the game rules, a description of what the client wants,
the list of goals they need to tick-off, and instructions on how the assessment mechanism works.

The assignment is deliberately designed to be too large to complete in the time 
available, thus forcing students to select sensible and managable chunks to
design, as would happen in a real world iterative development team.
Some specific functionality is marked as being important, such as some aspects crucial
for game play, and others, such as support for mobility, are required to achieve higher grades.
Students need to derive their own use cases from these documents (though in future years
we may change this). 

Students meet weekly with a TA to discuss their evolving design, to ask questions
about the material, and to tick off the various goals that they need to accomplish.

## Educational Goals

The goal of the assignment is to have students design a large software system
incrementally, to plan this design process, to reflect on what they are
doing and why, to evaluateand provide feedback on designs,
and to incrementally improve their design and process.

## Intermediate Stages

Students meet with TAs once per week. There are seven meetings in total.
Two of these meetings (#3 and #5) will be devoted to peer feedback.
In such peer feedback meetings, two groups will meet with a TA. The groups will 
give each other feedback, under the moderation of the TA. 

## Stage Submissions


At each intermediate stage, students submit their current design documents. 
This is mandatory. No specific constraints are imposed on the submission.

## Peer Review

The goal of peer review is to allow groups to evaluate and provide feedback to improve
other group's designs, and to develop their own design review skills.

Each group will be reviewed by one other group. There will be a mutual review of
each others work, which could form the basis for a discussion. A TA will be
present to moderate the discussion.

The discussion will take place during a weekly meeting. 1/3 of the meeting will be devoted
to one team providing feedback on the other teams design, 1/3 for doing the reverse, and
1/3 for any discussion that might ensure, including resolving any misunderstandings in
concepts or requirements.


Rubric: provide specific comments on design documents based on the following aspects
- Comprehensibility, following conventions, quality of documentation
- How well the designs cover the selected use cases
- Adherence of design to the GRASP design principles
- The subset of complete system chosen as current design effort - core elements or perhipheral, easy elements?
- Provide concrete examples to support each point.

## Expert Review

Weekly meetings will alternate between expert review meetings and peer review meetings.
At expert meetings, TAs will give feedback, mainly by answering student questions and
by assessing students as they tick off goals.

At the peer review meeting, the experts (TAs) will act mainly as moderators.
At the end of the meeting, the TA will give comments on the feedback given
based on the following rubric. (Other feedback may be given on designs.)

Rubric:
- How well did the feedback follow principles of design evaluation?
- How was the feedback received?
- Did the feedback identify trivial or more serious problems?

## Grading

The work will be assessed during meetings. One of the goals that the students need to tick off will 
correspond to "providing feedback on another teams assignment". This could be broken into a number
of different levels, corresponding to the level of feedback provided: superficial, decent, extensive.

As providing feedback corresponds to one of the tick-off-able goals, the quality of the feedback
will effect their grade. Ultimately, students need to decide in advance how much effort they need
to put into this based on which grade they are aiming for.

Other goals concern software design specific issues such as applying design patterns, applying 
GRASP principles .... Some concern teamwork, and others concern modifying designs based on
feedback received.

As lots of rounds of feedback are provided already and students' submissions are not directly assessed,
goals are, students' submissions are not considered most of the time when ticking of goals.

Grading typically occurs in groups but each individual needs to be involved in the presentation
for each goal. This requires planning in advance for the team to avoid one member doing all
the talking and preventing others from ticking off the goal. 

## Thoughts

The assessment is a design exercise and details of designs should diverge fairly rapidly, making cheating is less of a concern. Indeed, students are tested by the TA orally, so any copying needs to come with appropriate understanding (and understanding is the ultimate goal). Thus students are also given the opportunity to learn by seeing other students' designs.

The choice between optional and mandatory submission was tricky. Weaker students may opt out of the
feedback step, though they are the ones most likely to benefit. 
Making the  submissions mandatory goes against one of the other pedagogic goals of this assignment,
namely to get students to plan their own submissions.

One concern is that students could copy feedback from others, thereby increasing their chance of getting
a better grade. This is somewhat alleviated by the fact that the assignments upon which feedback is based
are likely to be very different, as these will be based on software designs, which will likely deviate
early during the course (assignments are on-going).
