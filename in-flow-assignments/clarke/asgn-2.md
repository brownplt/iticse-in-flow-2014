# Assignment Name

Advanced Dungeons and Design (AD&D)

## Course Context

This is the only assignment for the fourth year (first masters year) course
_Advanced Software Design_. This course is offered to a variety of CS, IT and 
other interested students. Students are required to have roughly 2 years worth
of CS units under the belt, including a second year course on object-oriented
programming. 

The course is essentially about object-oriented design, design patterns, refactoring,
UML, and it is the first course in which they do a largish design project.

Students learn (or receive a refresher) on iterative development methods.
They learn about some principles of good (OO) design which they need to
apply in their design. They learn about design evaluation and refactoring,
as design evaluation and  improvement (due to changing requirements, 
additional use cases, feedback!) is a key part of the course.

Although the course is about design, assessment is not based (exclusively) on the quality of
their final designs. Instead, students are given a list of goals (related to various
aspects of design) that they need to tick off. Students tick off goals by performing
some design work (fleshing out an architecture, employing design patterns, etc),
and then convincing TAs that the work they have done and the understanding they 
have gained allow the goal to be ticked off. Goals are partitioned according to
the possible grades students may obtain. In order to get a particular grade,
students need to tick off all goals for that grade (and lower grades). Each
topic covered by goals will come in a number of variants of increasing difficult, to
cover the different grades, so that students can tick off all lower graded goals 
while ticking off a higher graded goal. Other goals can be ticked off together.
This gives students the opportunity to reflect on their work and, in effect,
plan their own assessment. (_Students hate it_.)


## Assignment

Students are given a detailed description of a Dungeon-based board game and they are required
to design and implement a mobile-app+server based on this description, following an iterative development methodology.
The assignment is deliberately designed to be too large to complete in the time 
available, thus forcing students to select sensible and managable chunks to
design, as would happen in the real world.

Students meet weekly with a TA to discuss their evolving design, to ask questions
about the material, and to tick off the various goals that they need to accomplish.

## Educational Goals

_What is the purpose of giving this assignment?_

## Intermediate Stages

Students already meet with TAs once per week. Some of these meeting could be changed so that
one group gives another group feedback, or groups give each other feedback, under the guidance
of the TA. 

Currently there are 6 or 7 meeting with TAs. Two or three of these could be borrowed
for peer feedback. Perhaps the 3rd and 5th would be best.


## Stage Submissions

_At each intermediate stage, what would you like submitted? Is this an expectation or preference?_

## Peer Review

_At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?_

_How many peers will review, and how?_

_Include review prompts or rubrics that you would give to students._

## Expert Review

_At each intermediate stage, will there also be review by experts (and who are they)?_

_Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work: a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission by peers. Either or both could be considered for review. What rubric would you use for the expert review (if any)?_

## Grading

_How do you anticipate the work done at the  intermediate stages being assessed? (Assume limitless human and computer resources.)_

_(How) Will this assessment impact the final score on the assignment?_

_Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work: a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment._

## Thoughts

_Any and all thoughts you have (including whether an in-flow peer-review process even makes sense for this assignment)._

As this is a design exercise, details of designs should diverge fairly rapidly, so the cheating concerns had with other assignments are less of a concern. Indeed, students are tested by the TA orally, so any copying needs to come with appropriate understanding.
