# Assignment Name

Advanced Dungeons and Design (AD&D)

## Course Context

This is the only assignment for the fourth year (first masters year) course
_Advanced Software Design_. This course is offered to a variety of CS, IT and 
other interested students. Students are required to have roughly 2 years worth
of CS units under the belt, including a second year course on object-oriented
programming. 

The course is essentially about object-oriented design, software architecture, design patterns, refactoring,
UML, and it is the first course in which they do a largish design project.

Students learn (or receive a refresher) on iterative development methods.
They learn about some principles of good (OO) design which they need to
apply in their design. They learn about design evaluation and refactoring,
as design evaluation and  improvement (due to changing requirements, 
additional use cases, feedback!) are key parts of the course.

Although the course is about design, assessment is not based (exclusively) on the quality of
their final designs. Instead, students are given a list of goals (related to various
aspects of design) that they need to tick off. Students tick off goals by performing
some design work (fleshing out an architecture, employing design patterns, etc),
and then convincing TAs that the work they have done and the understanding they 
have gained allow the goal to be ticked off. Goals are partitioned according to
the possible grades students may obtain (3, 4, 5). In order to get a particular grade,
students need to tick off all goals for that grade (and lower grades). Each
topic covered by goals will come in a number of variants of increasing sophistication, to
cover the different grades, so that students can tick off all lower graded goals 
while ticking off a higher graded goal. Groups of goals can be ticked off together.
This gives students the opportunity to reflect on their work and, in effect,
plan their own assessment. 


## Assignment

Students are given a detailed description of a Dungeon-based board game and they are required
to design and implement a mobile-app+server based on this description, following an iterative development methodology.
The assignment is deliberately designed to be too large to complete in the time 
available, thus forcing students to select sensible and managable chunks to
design, as would happen in a real world iterative development set up.

Students meet weekly with a TA to discuss their evolving design, to ask questions
about the material, and to tick off the various goals that they need to accomplish.

## Educational Goals

The goal of the assignment is to have students design a large software system
incrementally, to plan this design process, to reflect on what they are
doing and why, to evaluate designs and to incrementally improve their design and process.

## Intermediate Stages

Students already meet with TAs once per week. Some of these meeting could be changed so that
one group gives another group feedback, or groups give each other feedback, under the guidance
of the TA. 

Currently there are 6 or 7 meetings with TAs. Two or three of these could be borrowed
for peer feedback. Perhaps the 3rd and 5th would be best.


## Stage Submissions


At each intermediate state, students submit their current design documents. 
This is a preference --- the feedback is for their benefit.

(On the other hand, weaker students tend to be the ones who need feedback the 
most, and they are likely to not take full advantage of an optional submission
point.)

## Peer Review

The goal of peer review is to allow groups to evaluate and provide feedback to improve
other group's designs, and to develop their own design review skills.

Each group will be reviewed by one other group. (Probablly) there will be a mutual review of
each others work, which could even form the basis for a discussion (though with 8-10 people
in the room, this might not be feasible).

The discussion will take place during a weekly meeting. 1/3 of the meeting will be devoted
to one team providing feedback on the other teams design, 1/3 for doing the reverse, and
1/3 for any discussion that might ensure, including resolving any misunderstandings in
concepts or requirements.

Rubric:
- Are all elements of the design document comprehensible, following UML conventions, etc?
- Does the design adequately cover the stated use cases?
- Does the design adhere to the GRASP design principles?

## Expert Review

Weekly meetings will alternate between expert review meetings and peer review meetings.
At the peer review meeting, the experts (TAs) will act mainly as moderators.

At the end of the meeting, the TA will give comments on the feedback given.

Rubric:
- Was feedback issued based on principles of design evaluation covered in the course?
- Was the feedback useful?
- Did the feedback identify trivial or more serious problems?

## Grading

The work will be assessed during meetings. One of the goals that the students need to tick off will 
correspond to "providing feedback on another teams assignment". This could be broken into a number
of different levels, corresponding to the level of feedback: superficial, decent, extensive.

As providing feedback corresponds to one of the tick-off-able goals, the quality of the feedback
will effect their grade. Ultimately, students need to decide in advance how much effort they need
to put into this based on which grade they are aiming for.

As lots of rounds of feedback are provided already and students' submissions are not directly assessed,
goals are, students' submissions are not considered.

## Thoughts

As this is a design exercise, details of designs should diverge fairly rapidly,   cheating is less of a concern. Indeed, students are tested by the TA orally, so any copying needs to come with appropriate understanding.

One concern with having optional submissions is that weaker students, who presumably would benefit more
from feedback, are less likely to be in a position to have their submissions ready (conjecture).
