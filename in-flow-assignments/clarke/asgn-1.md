# Assignment Name

"I can write programs"

## Course Context

This is a first year course of 150 aruswnra. It's the first serious programming 
course, offered to CS, IT and some engineering students. Students have encountered 
Python briefly, but they are not expected to know much about programming. 
They will have had an introduction to computer science. The course is 
based on a functional language (Standard ML, but Haskell in the future). 
Students typically have no experience with functional programming, 
and this levels the playing field.

## Assignment

The assignment asks students two write a collection of functions to
solve a relatively small problem. Students are expected to write
appropriate helper functions, to document their code in terms of
informal pre- and post-conditions, examples, and so forth.
Submitted solutions are expected to satisfy the supplied test suite.


Submitted solutions are automatically tested against a different
test suite. Code and comments are then inspected by TAs â€“ each 
TA grades about 14 assignments.

One lab session is devoted to the assignment about 1 week before it is due.

Students who fail the assignment are obliged to attend a special tutorial
that will essentially tell them how to solve the problem. Students may
then resubmit to obtain a maximum of a passing grade for the assignment.

## Educational Goals

What is the purpose of giving this assignment?

## Intermediate Stages

Identify one or more intermediate stages that would
yield reviewable artifacts.

Each stage should be unambiguous to students.
(It might be defined by content, time, both, etc.)

This is the key to adapting an assignment to
in-flow peer-review.

## Stage Submissions

At each intermediate stage, what would you like
submitted? Is this an expectation or preference?

## Peer Review

At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?

How many peers will review, and how?

Include review prompts or rubrics that you would
give to students.

## Expert Review

At each intermediate stage, will there also be
review by experts (and who are they)?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for review.
What rubric would you use for the expert review (if any)?

## Grading

How do you anticipate the work done at the 
intermediate stages being assessed?
(Assume limitless human and computer resources.)

(How) Will this assessment impact the final score
on the assignment?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment.

## Thoughts

Any and all thoughts you have (including whether
an in-flow peer-review process even makes sense
for this assignment).
