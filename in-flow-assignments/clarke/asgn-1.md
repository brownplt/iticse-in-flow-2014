# Assignment Name

Pinball Wizard!

## Course Context

This is a first year course of 150 students. It's the first serious programming 
course, offered to CS, IT and some engineering students. Students have encountered 
Python briefly, but they are not expected to know much about programming. 
They will have had an introduction to computer science. The course is 
based on a functional language (Standard ML, but Haskell in the future). 
Students typically have no experience with functional programming, 
and this levels the playing field.

## Assignment

The assignment asks students two write a collection of functions to
solve a relatively small problem -- tracking a pinball through
a grid containing some  bumpers positioned at 45 degrees, 
checking well-formedness of the input data and so forth, ... 
Students are expected to write appropriate helper functions, to document their code in terms of
informal pre- and post-conditions, examples, and so forth.
Submitted solutions are expected to satisfy the supplied test suite.


Submitted solutions are automatically tested against a different
test suite. Code and comments are then inspected by TAs – each 
TA grades about 14 assignments.

Three weeks are alotted to complete the assignment. Assignments are
completed in pairs.

One lab session is devoted to the assignment about 1 week before it is due.

Students who fail the assignment are obliged to attend a special tutorial
that will essentially tell them how to solve the problem. Students may
then resubmit to obtain a maximum of a passing grade for the assignment.

## Educational Goals

The eductational goal is to test students mastery of basic programming
constructs, their ability to break a problem down into smaller, solvable
units, and to write coherent specifications of the functions that solve
the problem.

## Intermediate Stages

After either 1 or 2 weeks (or both) students could submit their current
version of the assignment.

## Stage Submissions

Typically, the assignment is broken into several functions of increasing difficulty.
Students could submit some of those functions week _t-2_ and and another batch at week _t-1_.

The requested functions should be submitted. 

## Peer Review

_At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?_
At peer review stage, students will perform a manual inspection of 
the code and specification to check for readability and (perceived) correctness.


Each pair of students working together could review one other assignments each, individually,
thereby generating two batches of feedback for each submitted assignment.

Rubric (on scale of 1-5, with 1 being appalling and 5 being amazing):

* Does the code seem to be correct?
* Does the specification make sense?
* Does the code match the specification?
* Do given examples satisfy specification?

## Expert Review


At this stage, the expert review could be undertaken by TAs. This review would check that the original submission is sufficiently sensible to warrent feedback, and that effort has been expended on providing feedback. Also checks should be made for grossly misleading feedback. These checks should be very lightweight, and are in place to ensure that 1) sufficient work went into the original submission, 2) that effort was put into giving feedback, and 3) that misguided feedback will not create problems.

Rubric (on scale of 1-5, with 1 being appalling and 5 being amazing):
* Does the student's comments reflect that they have read and understood the given code and specification?
* Are the comments likely to be good feedback?
* Are the comments misleading?

TA wil provide feedback only in last case, to avoid impact of misleading comments.

## Grading



Students and teachers alike have access to a system called the Student Portal.
Students will submit their intermediate assignments to the student portal.
These will be redistributed to other students (functionality already exists),
who will then provide feedback. This can then be checked by the TAs and 
passed on to original students. The feedback can then be returned to the
students.

It is not entirely clear how the assessment will impact the final score.
On one hand, it needs to be assessed to ensure that students do submit
and that they make an effort, but we need to avoid punishing them if they
do make an effort and do a poor job (it will be their first time).

This actually applies equally well to both the original submission and the feedback.

Most likely, we will grade this using a single bit -- done sufficently well or not done.
If they do not do it sufficiently well, they fail the whole assignment.
(Note that the bar will be pretty low.)

The student's assignment itself will not be graded, except to ensure that what has
been submitted is of sufficient quality to receive feedback.


## Thoughts

This is a good assignment for peer review. In a sense, tutorial sessions are already provided for students seeking assistence, but this would not involve a review of their code, as such – that said, they are 4 hour long sessions, so students could get some feedback if they can get enough TA time. 

In-flow peer review will have a clear impact on the time pressure students will experience. A positive side effect is that the system will actually help students start early, and thus have a better chance of doing a good job. My course accounts for 2/3 of students' load, so we have good knowledge of what their overall load is and can readily make adjustments to avoid too much pressure.

My main concern is  cheating. If a student sees one assignment while trying to complete her own, what is to stop her using what she has seen to improve her own solution. She can just copy it off the screen – that said, we do use tools for checking for plagiarism.

Another concern is turn-around time. Delays in providing feedback and/or grading the assignments will have a negative impact on students, who may actually be waiting for the feedback before they proceed with their work (conjecture).

Avoiding misleading feedback seems to be an issue.

Grading formative assessment is a tough one. We grade it only to ensure that students do it,
but we also don't want to punish students who have done the original assignment poorly, as
we want the feedback to truly help them. (How can one tell the difference between a 
low-effort submission and a high-effort, low comprension submission?)
