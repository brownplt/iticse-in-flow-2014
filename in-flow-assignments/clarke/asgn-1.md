# Assignment Name

Pinball Wizard!

## Course Context

This is a first year course of 150 students. It's the first serious programming 
course, offered to CS, IT and some engineering students. Students encountered 
Python briefly in an earlier course that introduces computer sciences, but 
they are not expected to know much about programming.  The course is 
based on a functional language (currently Standard ML, but Haskell in the future). 
Students typically have no experience with functional programming, 
and this helps to level the playing field.

## Assignment

The assignment asks students too write a collection of functions to
solve a relatively small problem -- tracking a pinball through
a grid containing some  bumpers positioned at 45 degrees, 
checking well-formedness of the input data and so forth, ... 
The names of and types of the functions are provided, in part
to facilitate automatic testing. Students are expected to write 
code for the functions and appropriate helper functions, to document their code using of
informal pre- and post-conditions, examples, and so forth.
Submitted solutions are expected to satisfy the supplied test suite;
this is necessary for a passing grade.
To determine the final grade, submitted solutions are automatically 
tested against a different test suite. Code and comments are then 
inspected by TAs.

Two or three weeks are alotted to complete the assignment. Assignments are
completed and graded in pairs.  Each TA grades about 14 assignments.

One lab session is devoted to the assignment about 1 week before it is due.

Students who fail the assignment are obliged to attend a special tutorial
that will essentially tell them how to solve the problem. Such students may
then resubmit to obtain a maximum of a passing grade for the assignment.
(Other students may of course attend the special tutorials, though resubmission
cannot improve their grade, so is pointless.)


## Educational Goals

The eductational goal is to test students mastery of basic programming
constructs, their ability to break a problem down into smaller, solvable
units, and to write coherent specifications of the functions that solve
the problem.

We will provide students with a description of the pedagogical goals of each of
aspects of the assignment (possibly as a learning agreement).


## Intermediate Stages

After either 1 or 2 weeks (or both) students could submit their current
version of the assignment.

## Stage Submissions

Typically, the assignment is broken into several functions of increasing difficulty.
Students could submit some of those functions week _t-2_ and and another batch at week _t-1_.

The requested functions should be submitted. 

## Peer Review

At peer review stage, students will perform a manual inspection of 
the code and pre- and post-conditions to check for readability and (perceived) correctness.

Each pair of students working together could review one other assignments each, individually,
thereby generating two batches of feedback for each submitted assignment.

Rubric: provide free form comments on the following topics:

* The correctness of the assignment. Which parts seem to be correct, which parts are wrong, and which parts are difficult to assess? Suggest improvements for the parts that are not correct.
* The pre- and post-condition specifications. How well do these match the description provided? How easy are these to understand? What simplifications and improvements are possible? 
* How well the code matches the pre- and post-condition specifications. 
* How well the provided examples satisfy the given specification.

## Expert Review

After the feedback has been submitted, an expert review could be undertaken by TAs. This needs to require a short amount of time per TA. This review would check that the original submission is sufficiently sensible to warrent feedback, and that sufficient effort has been expended on providing feedback. Also checks should be made for grossly misleading feedback. These checks should be very lightweight, and are in place to ensure that 1) sufficient work went into the original submission, 2) that effort was put into giving feedback, and 3) that misguided feedback will not create problems.

Rubric (on scale of 1-5, with 1 being appalling and 5 being amazing, plus comments):
* How well do the students' feedback reflect that they have read and understood the given code and specification?
* How useful will this feedback be?
* Are the comments misleading? (Provide details)

TA wil provide feedback only in last case, to avoid misleading comments having any lasting impact.

## Grading


Students and teachers alike have access to a system called the Student Portal.
Students will submit their intermediate assignments to the student portal.
These  will automatically be redistributed to other students,
who will then provide feedback. This can then be checked by the TAs and 
passed back to the original students.

As this is the first time students will be completing a programming
assignment and the first time they will use in-flow feedback. 
For these reasons, feedback will not affect the final scoores.
Providing adequate feedback will, however, be mandatory. 

The student's assignment itself will not be graded at the intermediate stage, 
except to ensure that what has been submitted is of sufficient quality to 
receive feedback.

Thus the only requirements for the intermediate submission are that students
participate adequately. 

Students will have the opportunity to improve their assignment based on
the feedback received. 


## Thoughts

This is a good assignment for peer review. In a sense, tutorial sessions are already provided for students seeking assistence, but this would not involve a review of their code, as such – that said, they are 4 hour long sessions, so students could get some feedback if they can get enough TA time. 

In-flow peer review will have a clear impact on the time pressure students experience. A positive side effect is that the system will actually encourage students to start early, and thus have a better chance of doing a good job. My course accounts for 2/3 of students' load, so we have good knowledge of what their overall workload is at any time and can readily make adjustments to avoid too much pressure.

My main concern ischeating. If a student sees one assignment while trying to complete her own, what is to stop her using what she has seen to improve her own solution. She can just copy it off the screen. To counter this after the fact, we extensively use plagiarism detection tools – these catch enough students during the first assignment to highly discourage the whole class from cheating in subsequent assignments.

Another concern is turn-around time. Delays in providing feedback and/or grading the assignments will have a negative impact on students, who may actually be waiting for the feedback before they proceed with their work (conjecture).

Avoiding misleading feedback seems to be an issue. We address this by getting a TA to check and identify such feedback.

Whether or not to grading formative feedback is a tough choice. We make it mandatory to ensure that students do it. 
We don't grade the initial submissions as we also don't want to punish students who have done the  assignment poorly, as
we want the feedback to truly help them. The challenge is determining the difference between a low-effort, low quality submission and a high-effort, low comprension submission? 

Another challenge is avoiding students doing nothing (or just the bare minimum) to get access to the feedback phase and hence access to other students' assignment.
