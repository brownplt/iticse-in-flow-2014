# Assignment Name

"I can write programs"

## Course Context

This is a first year course of 150 students. It's the first serious programming 
course, offered to CS, IT and some engineering students. Students have encountered 
Python briefly, but they are not expected to know much about programming. 
They will have had an introduction to computer science. The course is 
based on a functional language (Standard ML, but Haskell in the future). 
Students typically have no experience with functional programming, 
and this levels the playing field.

## Assignment

The assignment asks students two write a collection of functions to
solve a relatively small problem -- tracking a pinball through
a grid consisting of bumpers, checking well-formedness of the
input, ... Students are expected to write appropriate helper functions, to document their code in terms of
informal pre- and post-conditions, examples, and so forth.
Submitted solutions are expected to satisfy the supplied test suite.


Submitted solutions are automatically tested against a different
test suite. Code and comments are then inspected by TAs – each 
TA grades about 14 assignments.

Three weeks are alotted to complete the assignment. Assignments are
completed in pairs.

One lab session is devoted to the assignment about 1 week before it is due.

Students who fail the assignment are obliged to attend a special tutorial
that will essentially tell them how to solve the problem. Students may
then resubmit to obtain a maximum of a passing grade for the assignment.

## Educational Goals

The eductational goal is to test students mastery of basic programming
constructs, their ability to break a problem down into smaller, solvable
units, and to write coherent specifications of the functions that solve
the problem.

## Intermediate Stages

After either 1 or 2 weeks (or both) students could submit their current
version of the assignment.

## Stage Submissions

Typically, the assignment is broken into several functions of increasing difficulty.
Students could submit some of those functions week _t-2_ and and another batch at week _t-1_.

The requested functions should be submitted. 

## Peer Review

_At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?_

_How many peers will review, and how?_

_Include review prompts or rubrics that you would give to students._

Each pair of students working together could review one other assignments each, individually,
thereby generating two batches of feedback for each submitted assignment.


## Expert Review

_At each intermediate stage, will there also be review by experts (and who are they)?_

_Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work: a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission by peers. Either or both could be considered for review. What rubric would you use for the expert review (if any)?_

## Grading

_How do you anticipate the work done at the intermediate stages being assessed?_
_(Assume limitless human and computer resources.)_

_(How) Will this assessment impact the final score on the assignment?_

_Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work: a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment._

## Thoughts

_Any and all thoughts you have (including whether an in-flow peer-review process even makes sense for this assignment)._

In-flow peer review will have a clear impact on the time pressure students will experience. A positive side effect is that the system will actually help students start early, and thus have a better chance of doing a good job. My course accounts for 2/3 of students' load, so we have good knowledge of what their overall load is and can readily make adjustments to avoid too much pressure.

My main concern is about cheating. If a student sees one assignment while trying to complete her own, what is to stop her using what she has seen to improve her own solution. She can just copy it off the screen – that said, we do use tools for checking for plagiarism.
