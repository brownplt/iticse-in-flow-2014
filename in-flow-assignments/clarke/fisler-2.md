# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

I like the group-discussion component that follows on the peer
review.  Everyone will likely learn more from some back-and-forth
exchange about the review comments.  

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your
assignments?

It is good that providing group feedback is part of the project
grading.  Depending on how you structure the peer review part, is
there a chance that students "copy" feedback from classmates and pass
it off as their own to raise their grade on giving group feedback?

(Not something coming up from my assignment) Your assignment
description talks about the assignment being too large, so picking
what to focus on is a key part of the assignment (that's neat) -- this
seems a good item to have students assess about each other's work.  Is
that explicit in your vision of the peer review?

# Any other comments on course structure?

One interesting question raised by this assignment is how to best have
TA-feedback and peer-review-feedback complement one another (this
seems a useful question for this WG to consider overall).

If you haven't seen it, take a look at some of Chris Hundhausen's work
on peer review in a software design studio course.  He uses
TA-facilitated group peer review, which sounds like it might fit your
high-level model.

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Be clearer on what students are given up front for the assignment.
The rubric suggests that the use cases are given, for example, but
this isn't stated explicitly.
