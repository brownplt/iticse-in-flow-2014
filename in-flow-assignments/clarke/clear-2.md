# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?
Regular group meetings with TA's have merit
# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?
Is there any consideration of teamwork and how that might be assessed?  Maybe a summative assessment based on quality of the review or inspection could also be considered, to address the need for intermediate deliverables to be made visible.  This could be applied at individual, pair or team level
# Any other comments on course structure?
How does the grading distinguish between team and individual assessments?
# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?
Generally good, but a bit of tidying needed and the team and individual grading could be made clearer.
