## Course Context

To be offered for the first time in Fall 2014. This is a third-semester
course on ``programming methodology'' using Scala. The students have
one year of Java experience. This is the 4th homework assignment in
the course. Students have been exposed to functional programming
(i.e., structural recursion, recursive data types, and higher-order functions) 
for three weeks when this assignment is released.

## Assignment

Students are provided an three implementation of maps: sorted association lists,
(unbalanced) binary search trees, and AVL trees. These data structures and
algorithms have been presented in class. Students have to build the framework
to benchmark their performance.

## Educational Goals

- Observe, empirically, the running time of O(n) and O(log n) algorithms to
  insert and lookup elements in a map.
- Writing recursive functions: e.g., generate random/ordered lists of numbers,
  insert a list of values into aforementioned data structures, and lookup a list of 
  values.
- Writing higher-order functions: functions to insert values into lists/BST/AVL
  vary only in the type and the name of the insert function. Identify the template
  and abstract into a higher-order function.

## Intermediate Stages

1. Write a higher-order function that calculates the time needed to execute another
   function, averaged over N runs.
2. Write a function to generate a list of N integers that are random/ordered.
3. Write a function to insert N values into a map data structure.
4. Write a benchmark that using above functions that plots running times.


## Stage Submissions

All expectations:


## Peer Review

At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?

How many peers will review, and how?

Include review prompts or rubrics that you would
give to students.

## Expert Review

At each intermediate stage, will there also be
review by experts (and who are they)?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for review.
What rubric would you use for the expert review (if any)?

## Grading

How do you anticipate the work done at the 
intermediate stages being assessed?
(Assume limitless human and computer resources.)

(How) Will this assessment impact the final score
on the assignment?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment.

## Thoughts

Any and all thoughts you have (including whether
an in-flow peer-review process even makes sense
for this assignment).
