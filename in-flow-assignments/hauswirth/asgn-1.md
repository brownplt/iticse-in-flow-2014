# Assignment Name

What is the assignment called?
A snappy codename may be useful for later discussions.

## Course Context

This assignment fits our "Programming Fundamentals II" (PF2) second-semester Bachelor course at the University of Lugano (http://boole.inf.usi.ch/pf2-2014/index.html). At the start of the course students are expected to know Python (from the first semester programming course), and throughout this course they learn object-oriented programming in Java. We use a "Conversational Classroom" approach to teaching. Concurrently to PF2 students also take "Software Ateliner II" (SA2), which includes a group programming project during the second half of the semester. This year those projects are based on Android.

We usually have between 15 and 40 students (due to administrative reasons students who failed the first semester programming course start taking PF2, and they usually either drop out or fail in the end, significantly reducing the number of students over the course of the semester).

We usually have two teaching assistants (PhD students who TA in addition to being RAs) for this course, plus two TAs for the concurrent programming project.

## Assignment

What is the assignment asking students to do?

## Educational Goals

What is the purpose of giving this assignment?

## Intermediate Stages

Identify one or more intermediate stages that would
yield reviewable artifacts.

Each stage should be unambiguous to students.
(It might be defined by content, time, both, etc.)

This is the key to adapting an assignment to
in-flow peer-review.

## Stage Submissions

At each intermediate stage, what would you like
submitted? Is this an expectation or preference?

## Peer Review

At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?

How many peers will review, and how?

Include review prompts or rubrics that you would
give to students.

## Expert Review

At each intermediate stage, will there also be
review by experts (and who are they)?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for review.
What rubric would you use for the expert review (if any)?

## Grading

How do you anticipate the work done at the 
intermediate stages being assessed?
(Assume limitless human and computer resources.)

(How) Will this assessment impact the final score
on the assignment?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment.

## Thoughts

Any and all thoughts you have (including whether
an in-flow peer-review process even makes sense
for this assignment).
