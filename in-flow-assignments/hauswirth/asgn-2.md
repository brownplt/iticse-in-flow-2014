# Assignment Name

What is the assignment called?
A snappy codename may be useful for later discussions.

## Course Context

This assignment fits our "Software Performance" (SP) Masters course at the University of Lugano (http://boole.inf.usi.ch/sp-2013/index.html). The course teaches how the various layers of a computer system interact and affect the resulting performance. It performs two cuts down the system stack: one about the "state" and the other about the "behavior" of a system. The discussion of "state" investigates memory usage of applications, leak detection, garbage collection, virtual memory management, and cache performance. The discussion of "behavior" investigates call graphs, dynamic class loading, shared libraries and dynamic linking, control flow graphs, exception handling, compiler optimizations, and branch prediction. The course uses Java virtual machines and their internal operation as a running example and teaches basic static and dynamic program analysis techniques. Given the quantitative aspects of performance, the course introduces basic instrumentation and measurement tools, experimentation and evaluation approaches, and data analysis and visualization techniques.

Concurrently most SP students also take "Software Performance Lab" (SP Lab), which includes an indivudual programming project during the second half of the semester. Last year the projects involved modifications to the Jikes RVM or to Jikes RDB (http://sape.inf.usi.ch/rdb).

We usually have between 5 and 15 students, and we have one TA for SP and another TA for the SP Lab. The TAs usually are PhD students who also perform research in the systems area.

## Assignment

What is the assignment asking students to do?

## Educational Goals

What is the purpose of giving this assignment?

## Intermediate Stages

Identify one or more intermediate stages that would
yield reviewable artifacts.

Each stage should be unambiguous to students.
(It might be defined by content, time, both, etc.)

This is the key to adapting an assignment to
in-flow peer-review.

## Stage Submissions

At each intermediate stage, what would you like
submitted? Is this an expectation or preference?

## Peer Review

At each intermediate stage, what will peer-review do?

How many peers will review, and how?

Include review prompts or rubrics that you would
give to students.

## Expert Review

At each intermediate stage, will there also be
review by experts (and who are they)?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for review.
What rubric would you use for the expert review (if any)?

## Grading

How do you anticipate the work done at the 
intermediate stages being assessed?
(Assume limitless human and computer resources.)

(How) Will this assessment impact the final score
on the assignment?

Recall that at each stage, there are two kinds of work:
a student's submission, and the reviews of that submission
by peers. Either or both could be considered for assessment.

## Thoughts

Any and all thoughts you have (including whether
an in-flow peer-review process even makes sense
for this assignment).
