# Are there things your assignments could do better based on reading this?

Perhaps having a more open ended assignment could make it easier to design more peer reviewed assignments.

# Are there things this assignment could do better based on your assignments?

I again doubt it. This assignment is very open ended and could work very differently with different people and I did not have very novel ideas on my assignments. The only thing I could suggest is adding some reflection phases between the steps: one benefit of studying the work of other students is in figuring out the different ideas present in it. Could the students be instructed explicitly to contrast their work with that of others in hope of improving their own understanding?

# Any other comments on course structure?

This seems like a quite tough course. I also find it a good idea to have expert input on the first stage of the project. This probably helps students to set reasonable goals.  

# Looking ahead to including these in a report, any writing comments?

Like in my work, it seems that we are not so willing to have student reviews affect the grades. Likewise, it seems that student reviews are not going through the course staff (mine neither). I wonder why this is. Also, like in my exercise, we do not seem to have much expert review in the middle stages of the exercise.
