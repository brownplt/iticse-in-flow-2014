This directory holds notes on papers and background readings.

Specific suggested papers should be listed in bib-notes.md. 

Topics or areas that we should look into should be added to the list
in topics-to-research.md.

If you want to upload an actual document (paper, report, etc), put it
in files with a descriptive filename.
