# Document Description

This is a place to record general areas that we think we need to cover
(at least briefly) in the report.   We will flesh these out into
concrete papers at a later date.

## Suggested Areas and Topics

* Getting students to reflect on their own work: best practices,
challenges, etc.

* In what way are peer solutions useful as examples?  Likely too large to be meaningful as worked examples, but must be some other foundation for what we expect good peer solutions to achieve

* Mental representations of code: how does looking at a peer solution to a problem a student has worked on interact with a student's own mental model of her own program?  Is having a mental model of one's own program enough for a student to create a sufficiently rich mental model of another student's program?
