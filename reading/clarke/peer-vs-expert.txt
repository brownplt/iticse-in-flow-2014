Fill in a summary for a related work section, and for your fellow WG members:

(Note: I made quite extensive notes on the paper but lost it somewhere but
lost it somewhere between Sweden and Italy, possibly Copenhagen. Here
is a first approximation of the paper. I'll try to do better when I return
home.)

The paper compares three approaches to giving feedback on written assignments
in a psychology course: feedback from a single peer, feedback from a single
topic expert, and feedback from multiple peers. The results indicate that
feedback from multiple peers results in better quality revisions than
feedback from an expert, with feedback from a single peer being the worse.
The hypothesised reason for this was that peers gave feedback that was 
phrased in terms that students could more easily comprehend.  
It certainly would be interesting to see whether the same results applied
to programming assignments.
