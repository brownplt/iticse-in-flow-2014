Fill in a summary for a related work section, and for your fellow WG members:

The paper describes the outcome of running an IT course more like a fine arts 
course than a traditional engineering course. This included projects that were 
more meaningful, public critique of results, and routing collaboration. 
This approach created a classroom culture where learning is a social and community process, 
rather than individualised, and the result was a greater retention of female students
than the tranditional engineering teaching approach.

The technique most relevant for in-flow peer review, though not completely the same,
is the approach to knowledge sharing during lab work. Students actively sort help
from any student, for example, by yelling questions out, resulting in a fluid exchange
of ideas and techniques. Even though the projects considered in these labs were run in 
an open, collaborative setting, cheating was avoiding by using individualised assignments.
