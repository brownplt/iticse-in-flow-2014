Fill in bibliographic information for other papers we should be reading that
you found from your assignment:

Talking about code: Integrating Pedagogical Code Reviews into Early Computing Courses, Hundhausen, 2013.
- This seems to be exactly about what we are doing


Peer review negotiations: Revision activities in ESL writing instruction, Mendonca, 1994
- Although peer review during process might be new for CSE, similar aspects
  can be found elsewhere. The most natural place to search is writing 
  instruction and here seems to be one article about the topic.

The effectiveness of peer tutoring in further and higher education: A typology and review of the literature, Topping, 1916
- I think terms like 'peer instruction', 'peer review', 'peer tutoring' should 
  be glanced over if for not any other reason than to delieneate our topic.
