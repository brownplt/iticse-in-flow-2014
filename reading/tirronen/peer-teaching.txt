its application in CS (http://www.peerinstruction4cs.org/latest-research/).
Pick one or two papers that are representative and sumarrize


Fill in a summary for a related work section, and for your fellow WG members:


# Short summary

Peer Instruction (PI), which is a specific form of student centered pedagogy
[3], has been shown to be a promising way for improve student performance [1]
and engagement [2] both in introductory courses [1] and upper-division courses
[6]. Peer instruction, as defined by Crouch et. al. [1], focuses on engaging
students in activities that require them to apply the core concepts under study
and to explain these concepts to their peers. Concretely, a class taught using
PI principles can consist of short presentations, each of which focuses on a
particular core concept and is tested by presenting students a conceptual
question, which the students first solve individually and then discuss in
groups. The PI pedagogies link with the concepts of blended learning and
flipped classroom [4] in that PI requires students to study preparatory
material before attending the class.

# My, freeform, thoughts

As a pedagogical approach, PI is not so very novel, but the relevant literature
compensates this for being quite thorough. All in all, PI seems to be a tested
and beneficial approach for classroom teaching. The difficulties of PI seem to
lie in the implementation, as discussed by Crouch et.al [1], it seems that PI
has it's own difficulties, which range from motivational to time management.
Further in the literature surveyed here the social aspects of PI, which to me
seem quite crucial for success, are largely elided.

Related to our undertaking, the most interesting component of PI is the student
peer discussions that are undertaken after presentation of each concept. This,
however, is not peer review.
